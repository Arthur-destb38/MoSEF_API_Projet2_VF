2021-05-08,You also don’t hear about me turning my $20 into $21.04 😎
2021-05-08,Survivorship bias is real and it's everywhere
2021-05-08,I'm one of those guys who fomo'd in 2017 and ended up half my coins  not even listed in exchanges.    Guys Do your own research and it's fine to take a quick profit just don't get too greedy!
2021-05-08,"Everybody talks about the Amazon that they thought about  buying but didn't,  but nobody talks about the blockbuster that they were thinking about buying but chose not to."
2021-05-08,You also don't hear about the early Bitcoin investors who have already made millions probably because they have better things to do. Most of us are still here posting because we haven't reached our life changing goals yet.
2021-05-08,You never hear about people like me that started off with $400 in crypto who now have $500 in crypto
2021-05-08,This isnt an reddit post anymore. This is life advice.
2021-05-08,Yeah imagine being the one to buy at the top of dogecoin's run 💀
2021-05-08,"The need to “Win more” (greed) is a weird quirk of humanity. I didn’t buy into BTC until 28k. I passed on every opportunity when it was $1, $5, $100, etc... because I didn’t really understand what was happening. I was around when 4chan users were tipping each other in BTC. I sold my BTC at $50k. I could’ve bought in sooner and I could’ve held longer, but I DOUBLED MY INVESTMENT in a very short period of time. That’s the DREAM in most investments.

Think about a traditional investment. If you make 20% in a year on a stock, that’s a really amazing stock. Take your profits and move on. Don’t agonize over how much you could’ve made with a different decision.

I think it’s because with cryptos, people are investing very small amounts. $50-$100 at a time and expecting $1000 or more in profit. If you put in $100 and get $120 out, you’ve done VERY well compared to almost anything else."
2021-05-08,I turned $0.06 into $8.28
2021-05-08,I am newish to crypto and i bought 100 into doge and cashed out at $1800 the other day.  Bought myself an electric longboard as a congratulatory present
2021-05-08,"Survivor bias. 

No one talks about their failures but we always want to repeat the one-in-a-million success."
2021-05-08, **but you don't hear about the \*thousands\* who put $1000 and are left with $0.1**
2021-05-08,I turned $500 into $915 in less than 2 days. To some that’s not much but to me that’s plenty
2021-05-08,"Yep, when it is a bull market like now, you have all these fairy tale, positive posts. And then when it’s a bear market, all these people suddenly disappear.

I lost 5 figures investing into cryptocurrency right after the Jan 2018 mega crash but right before that Fall brought a multi year bear market.

Cryptocurrency isn’t a safe investment stategy. Some win, many lose. I’m one of those many losers."
2021-05-08,Kinda hard when you see another “meme coin”shibtoken going up 600% and now at 26 on coinmarketcap. Loads of kids gained hard today.
2021-05-08,Exactly the same reason you only hear from a winning gambler.
2021-05-08,You also don’t hear about someone investing $100 in decent coins and getting $1000 return
2021-12-07,Any person elected to higher office should have to divest of ALL their investments and put everything into a blind trust. How is this such a difficult thing to get done?! I don't care if you're a Republican or a Democrat its straight up wrong to personally hold stock in any security you have direct control over.
2021-12-07,"tldr; Members of Congress shouldn't hold or trade digital assets in the same way that they should steer clear from stocks, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on Instagram.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.*"
2021-12-07,The only thing they should be allowed to legally invest in is S&P 500 or have a 401k type of account that is managed by a third party with higher levels of transparency.
2021-12-07,Blind trusts is the only way any lawmaker should be allowed to own any assets.
2021-12-07,Honestly this makes sense. Wish politicians did this with stocks as well. That is something they actually have inside information for.
2021-12-07,Plot twist: she holds eth
2021-12-07,If I became a politician my career would be extremely short lived once they found my Reddit account
2021-12-07,"I'm not mad at this. 

If she said she didn't hold any and then hated it different story. 

But not holding it and being impartial is fair enough in my eyes."
2021-12-07,"I don’t blame her and it’s a quiet voice in a larger sea of insider “not insider” trading. I don’t have an issue with them investing per the rules and this Is something that should be clarified in a similar manner. But dude, get rid of the special interest groups and superPACs."
2021-12-07,"So, this means that if she wasn't a lawmaker, she would have bitcoin."
2021-12-07,Its not really possible to be unbiased. But I appreciate the fact she's trying to actually do her job in congress. Hard work and doing your job in Washington DC really doesn't exist anymore.
2021-12-07,"She has been extremely vocal about the fact that Congress people shouldn't be able to hold or trade stocks, she has very vocally called for investigation into Robinhood scamming citizens, and meanwhile people in this thread are ignorant. While blaming her for ignorance. Hilarious.

>""Because we have access to sensitive information and upcoming policy, I do not believe members of Congress should hold/ trade individual stock and I choose not to hold any so I can remain impartial about policymaking. I also extend that to digital assets/ currencies (especially bc I sit on Financial Services Committee). So the answer is no bc I want to do my job as ethically and impartially as I can.""

From the article. Did any of y'all read it? Look like you didn't, just based an opinion off a headline. Embarrassing."
2021-12-07,"All law makers should only be able to hold index funds, no short term trading bs."
2021-12-07,That's solid of her. I think congress shouldn't be allowed to trade or invest. They should have to go through a third party who manages it.
2021-12-07,"This woman gets so much hate, but things like this shows she takes her job more seriously than the rest of these clown in Congress!"
2021-12-07,Fuck Politicians!! The real culprits behind everything.
2021-12-07,"Honestly, I respect that.

Also, shots fired at Ted Cruz. Guess she owes him one for Jan 6th 2020 though."
2021-12-07,Everything I hear about AOC really supports her being an upstanding individual devoted to her civic duty. Most of her critics have little to harp on other than her being a female. I hope she has a long and successful career. Hopefully more young informed politicians will be elected in the future and we weed out the literal dementia patients out of office.

2021-04-09,"Fuck this post. 
Elon musk wasn’t born a billionaire. He didn’t become a billionaire by stealing from people. He become one by providing extreme value to a high amount of people. 
And he is literally trying to expand our species to another planet to help us survive. (Whether for noble or selfish reasons is irrelevant.)
 (and irrelevant, but imo-) If there is someone that should be a billionaire, it is Elon Musk. All of his companies are pushing our species forward. What have you done for humanity?

Seriously. Fuck this garbage post and it’s close minded - jealous views. 

Sorry, end rant."
2021-04-09,One major thing about buying a tesla with BTC is that tesla won’t be converting that BTC back to fiat like almost everyone else does. That’s a big step for crypto IMO.
2021-04-09,I don’t think there is an „us“. We are all in crypto for different reasons. We are no tribe.
2021-04-09,We? You got a mouse in your pocket?
2021-04-09,Go outside and get your mind right.  This is the dumbest thing I've read online since I left facebook 10 years ago.
2021-04-09,"You’re weird as fuck to think the crypto industry is an “us”. It’s everyone for themselves, that’s why crypto is so important, no trust needed."
2021-04-09,"Dude crypto is decentralized and open. 

There is no us and them. 

It is something to you, it is something to millionaires, it is something to billionaires, it is something to someone in africa, it is something to someone in asia, etc. 

It’s different for everyone AND THAT’S OKAY."
2021-04-09,"How to mine moons:

1. say something controvertial about Musk
2. ??
3. profits"
2021-04-09,"Nobody here gives a fuck about you or your family. Most everybody in the crypto space is only here to make money. In that way Elon Musk is very similar to everyone else here. 

The only reason you say any of this is because Elon Musk is a celebrity. You hold him to a higher standard because he is a public figure. You wouldn't expect u/glasswallet to exercise the same level of activism as you do from Elon Musk. Even though there's plenty more I could do to for the crypto movement. 
Its ironic because he's probably done more for crypto than any one individual. (Other than Satoshi or Vitalik) I honestly don't think theres anything he could do to ever satisfy you. 

the fact is he doesn't owe you anything. Just because he has more reach than the average Joe doesn't mean he is obligated to dedicate his entire life to crypto. He's living his life as he personally sees fit just as everyone else here is. 

It should be enough for you that one of the most famous people in the world is discussing his interest in crypto and making moves. This post just comes off as salty. He's in the news because he's interesting, opinionated, and is a celebrity talking about crypto. Not because he's some crypto idol who's word is gospel."
2021-04-09,Anybody who is adopting crypto is an ally.  He's legitimized putting BTC on company balance sheets.
2021-04-09,"You may not like the guy. But he is repping crypto. That’s a good thing. I’d rather he embrace it than get on social media and call it a scam. We need all the posi vibes we can get. 

You’re giving him a platform by making this post by the way. Or maybe.. just maybe you’re farming moons."
2021-04-09,"Elon Musk doesn’t care about my family compared to who, commenters on Reddit? 99.99999% of the world doesn’t care about you or your family. That has nothing to do with being a billionaire, that’s how life works."
2021-04-09,Oh look another “I hate elon” post.
2021-04-09,Well who flew a rocket up your arse?! Why is it so bad to use him as a role model? He is changing the world while trolling the suits. Comparing him to Zuck is nonsense.
2021-04-09,Dude shut up. This type of post is so fucking dumb. People like you who use crypto as an ego boost truly make this space awful.
2021-04-09,Elon is definitely being trashed for being a pioneer. His wealth is in stock he does not sell. The man is trying his hardest to help humanity in so many ways. I welcome the down votes because I believe in him and all his companies. Someday a chip in my brain will control my robotic arm with my thoughts. If money was his goal he would've cashed out long ago.
2022-02-28,">Efrosinina said in an Instagram post that surrendering soldiers of the Russian military will receive 5 million rubles (US$45,000) in cryptocurrency or fiat, and an amnesty after trial. 

>with the Ukrainian government collecting over US$9.5 million in crypto donations via Bitcoin, Ether and USDT, as of press time.

So that's about 200 soldiers able to be paid out by donations alone. How much money are they actually willing to throw at this because $45k is a lot per soldier you're trying to get to defect..."

2022-02-28,"This is a great idea, buy out your enemy.

I can just see pawn stars + tanks - ""best i can do is 50 doge"". 

Imagine russian troops driving tanks into Kiev, getting out, getting a payment, Putting blue and yellow on the tank and then driving it back out to fight russia."
2022-02-28,"That's actually genius. Most of what I've seen of the Russian army was literal teens/kids in their 20s and out of shape guys looking like they're thinking about retirement.

They don't seem particularly thrilled fighting this war, and it looks like many didn't even know that was gonna happen. 

The sooner this all is over, the better"
2022-02-28,"in a few days, 5mill rubles will be worth 3 reddit moons."
2022-02-28,"50,000 usd to defect? I hope the Ukrainians are broadcasting this on every speaker in the country in Russian. Good show"
2022-02-28,"Most of Russia’s soldiers are likely conscripts. They’re soldiers bc it’s required of them, not bc they had a choice"
2022-02-28,"I hope this is not a lie, but that website don’t look legit.

Is this verified?"
2022-02-28,"That’s close to $60K USD! Not bad at all considering the other option is your death. 

Take the money or die."
2022-02-28,"They should give them an option to become Ukraine citizens because they are probably not safe going back to Russia, I'm sure many of them would jump at the opportunity...of course they would need a solid vetting process to not let spy's in they would have to be held until the war is over before they get citizenship but they can provide labor as a POW to help the cause and prove they are aligned with Ukraine in the meantime"
2022-02-28,About $60k for those wondering
2022-02-28,"Looking at videos of captured Russian troops, what gets me is how young and scared they all look.

Hopefully, this will give these young men a reason to stop following a tyrant and choose a more peaceful path."

2022-02-28,"Hehe am a Russian soldier and I surrender, take me away"
2022-02-28,"Guess that's a way to spend all that BTC/ETH in their wallets. Pretty brilliant, really. I wonder if they'll give out those NFTs.

There's a reason mercenaries of the past took payment in gold. Imagine taking payment in a fiat currency that could end up worthless if your side loses. No thanks."
2022-02-28,Soldiers who accepts this would probably have to start a new life somewhere else.
2022-02-28,"Which is worth ~~$50,000~~ wait ~~$45,000~~ no now ~~$40,000~~ uh, you guys better surrender fast."
2022-02-28,That's about 50K usd... 10-15 years worth of decent russian income... 100% take it.

2021-05-20,People are failing to recognize that Monday was tax day in the US and a lot of crypto boys and girls likely waited until Friday to realize they owed. I think Elon recognized an opportunity to MULTIPLY his pressure and manufacture a dip so that he/Tesla could accumulate.

The ISS took 10 years and 30 missions.

That and the whole wanting to build a single person submarine to send into a underwater passage so narrow, the divers had to take off their oxygen tanks to get through the narrowest point. 

The guy isn't exactly a prophet.

2021-02-09, 💯 This. I'm screwed. I have a huge amount of crypto in RH with 6 figure gains. I can't withdraw my coins and move them to another exchange without triggering a tax event. I'm stuck on RH. Even when coinbase was shitty I could move my BTC off without triggering taxes.
2021-02-09,First off dont buy crypto on Robinhood because you can not transfer it out of Robinhood.

2021-02-09,"Robinhood doesn’t get the money or cryptocurrency from whatever transaction you make with them immediately, even though it’s instant on your side. It takes several days for the transaction to be processed by the governing body’s, so when there is a stock (like gme) that is being bought at an insane rate, robinhood doesn’t have the capitol to front that cash, and has to restrict trading to protect itself"
2021-02-09,"That seriously needs to be inspected and sanctioned, cause it's criminal activity.

I guess they're good."
2021-02-09,You are not even purchasing btc on robinhood or etorro. You are trading the price.
2021-02-09,"They never owned any of the assets that they sell.

I have a clear bias against Robinhood... But given the Bitcoin costs a fortune to purchase, Robinhood's capital obviously cannot cover that kind of cash. 

Then again, you could purchase Bitcoin at larger exchanges that would definitely have couple thousands of them in their reserves (confirmed with Bitcoin blockchain  explorer)."
2021-02-09,"Not your key, not your coin.

4. Profit

It's almost as if Elon is trying to make money off of crypto.

Like, ""oops we only \*just\* realised that BTC mining is a thing!"""
2021-05-12,"On a different note, I got rugged by ELON MUSK & VITALIK BUTERIN on the Same Day!"
2021-05-12,Is this why BTC just shat the bed and took the market down with it?
2021-05-12,"For the millionth time, Elon is not your friend. He’s a billionaire who will continue to use crypto as an investment vehicle to make him more money. Y’all are crazy for thinking he won’t do this again when he one thousand percent will"
2021-05-12,"This has gotta be pre planned all along . Anounce bitcoin paymeny and bring awareness. Pump doge for further awareness. Then drop it to boost alt coins technology over bitcoin?

Like elon isn't a fucking idiot as much as most you guys don't like him. He knew about the environmental issue before accepting it as payment."
2021-05-12,I'm tired of this manipulator
2021-05-12,Lol this explains the Nano pump

Source: Am a closet NANO shill myself ;)"
2021-05-12,"""Tesla will not be selling any Bitcoin and we intend to use it for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy.""

That's a pretty important part of the statement really, indicates they're not selling it for a long time.

Also strange that they didn't state they won't be buying any more, but that could just be me pulling at straws, someone set a remindme for whenever their next financial report is due."
2021-05-12,Did Elon just ignite the flippening rocket?
2021-05-12,Can this guy just stop manipulating the markets for once? Damn.
2021-05-12,I do not understand why people follow and invest according to this wishy-washy little egghead it's taking everybody for a ride.
2021-05-12,"Sadly, people will probably sell their BTC because of this."
2021-05-12,"That Musk is a new McAfee. Think his reputation will be destroyed soon

P.s : in the end he will probably bet his prick on some coin"
2021-05-12,Guess it's time to buy more Nano maybe?
2021-08-13,can we get a post from the daughter now

2021-08-13,Dude was quicker with this than a Nano transaction
2021-08-13,I love how the original OP was flabbergasted that his girls dad didn’t want to talk to her new boyfriend about crypto. Also who the fuck wants to talk about crypto to an unreceptive audience the first time they meet them? 😂
2021-08-13,hahaha I understood this reference
2021-08-13,Amazing. This is the type of opportunistic moon farming that I can get behind
2021-08-13,"Was this the first time you all met? And would you say he gave an ""impassioned speech""?"
2021-08-13,"Dark times ahead of you, stay strong.

And remember you can always create your own crypto and make the guy swallow it then rug pull him and give the money to your daughter."
2021-08-13,This is a moon farming post I can get behind! Well done OP! 😂
2021-08-13,"Get your daughter to get his seed.

Just make sure its the right one."

2021-08-13,I wonder what the daughter is thinking now... This could be the first crypto soap opera :D
2021-08-13,Fantastic shitposting OP.

2021-09-26,"tldr; Citadel CEO Ken Griffin lied under oath when asked by US Representative Juan Vargas if Citadel had any collusion with Robinhood. ""Let me be perfectly clear, absolutely not,"" he replied when asked if he had any communication with the Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev. ""Turns out there WAS communication between them ($GME $AMC),"" he added. If the leaked documents are verified, Griffin could be facing major charges or a possible prison sentence.

2022-02-02,"tldr; A YouTuber named Ice Poseidon allegedly stole US$500,000 from his fans by convincing them to invest in CxCoin, a cryptocurrency that he created solely for his pump and dump scheme. After convincing his fans that this would be a long-term investment, the streamer pulled the rug which caused the cryptocurrency to nosedive to a value of basically nothing. He allegedly used some of the remaining US$300,000 to treat himself with a brand-new Tesla.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.*"

2022-02-02,We need youtube downvotes!!
2022-02-02,So Ice Poseidon is a piece of shit? Wow. I for one am shocked. Absolutely shocked. I don’t think I’ve ever been so shocked before. Shocked.
2022-02-02,Ice Poseidon is such a douche. Anyone who has had the unfortunate experience of watching some of his early Twitch stream days knows how dishonest he is.
2022-02-02,Sooner or later his smile will fade
2022-02-02,"If you throw money at internet influencers in any form, you deserve to be ripped off."

2022-02-02,Can we start throwing these crypto scammers in jail already? Especially if they are showing their dumb faces like this
2021-12-19,"Help him please , go report the NFT as stolen"
2021-12-19,"And Deviantart at least tries. All the other sites simply don't give a shit, and the amount of art stolen is so huge it's no wonder most artists want nothing to do with NFTs."
2021-12-19,Why would anyone buy an NFT without confirming it's signed by the artist? The best thing that can happen is that these NFTs have no resale value.
2021-12-19,"there are people organizing legal action against nft marketplaces that profit from art theft, take zero measures to prevent it in advance, while ignoring reports from the original artists and/or requiring them to waste hours of their time filling forms to prove it's their own work

https://nitter.net/CirenSong/status/1468977858487934986"
2021-12-19,"Woah, people are abusing the NFT system for money? Who could have seen that coming!!"
2021-12-19,Makes ownership of works using NFTs even more meaningless than it already is.
2021-12-19,"Nft marketplaces should do more against this crap.
That's so fucked up. And the buyer gets scammed too."
2021-12-19,People somehow find the worst ways to make money in new concepts. NFT art was supposed to benefit artists and yet scums take advantage of it.
2021-12-19,If you are buying NFT art with some expectation of number go up it is in your best interest to make sure it was minted by the original artist and/or it is the first time the image has appeared publicly.

2021-12-19,Original paintings are hard work. Stealing them is unacceptable. He should sue whoever is doing that shit rather than reporting them.
2021-12-19,"the blockchain doesn't lie

that doesn't mean people can't lie on the blockchain"
2021-12-19,This is an example of how stupid NFTs are for the purspose of art. I think they have a future as tickets and in video games. But as art NFTs are beyond stupid. This is proving the entire argument that people have been making about NFTs being stupid for art.
2021-12-19,"Who would've thought, people can copy jpegs."
2021-12-19,"I am open minded, but I am not convinced that using blockchain to enforce property rights on real world items—or even digital items—presents a compelling use case of cryptocurrency. If a trusted third party is required to arbitrate ownership over NFTs, land, concert tickets, then what is the point of putting them on chain? 

Another way of looking at it is: garbage in, garbage out. What is the benefit of blockchain’s immutability if people submit fraudulent information to it?

The best use case so far for crypto is money. Specifically money that is programmable and not “backed” by anything other than a robust network of miners or stakers."
2021-12-19,He's pretty good. I just took a screenshot of the image to use as my background.
2021-12-19,"Anyone see the new south park episode with butters being an NFT salesman? Shit, was, hilarious!"
2021-12-19,This is the reason why I am not interested in pursuing art
2021-12-19,"Rad that Deviant Art actively searches for stolen images. 

But also the whole ""NFTs verify ownership"" claim is obviously utter bullshit."
2021-08-01,"**Welcome to our second Predictions Tournament!**

The first Prediction Tournament generated many suggestions from users to make the polls more streamlined and avoid unnecessary spam on the front page. The admins took in all of the feedback from trialing communities and modified the UI so that all polls are condensed to one prediction post.  Clicking on “r/CryptoCurrency Predictions Tournament” at the top of this post will bring you to the predictions tab where all polls can be viewed individually. 

**Please note the following additional changes:**

- While all polls in this tournament are open for voting until 5PM Monday PST, not all of the predictions come to term on the same date. Carefully read each poll before predicting.

- The admins have added a “sneak peak” feature for [Reddit premium holders](https://www.reddit.com/premium) that allows them to view how other users are predicting before making their bet. 


**The prizes for this tournament are:**

- 1st place: 500 Moons and 1 week of Reddit premium 

- 2nd place: 250 Moons

- 3rd place: 125 Moons

2021-11-01,"This token should be used as the poster-child for a rugpull token:

1. Locked out from selling
2. Website is no longer up (or was never up from the start...I can't really remember. There are other tokens that don't have working websites even when they get listed)
3. Abnormal price movement (logic states that if value goes up quickly over time, it can also go down quickly over time due to poor liquidity amongst other factors)
4. Token has no purpose or fundamentals behind
5. Name of the token should have been a massive red flag

I am still learning about economics and crypto so I may have made mistakes in the points above. Welcome any feedback or improvements."

As someone who spent a lot of free time browsing the web back then in my early twenties, I had heard of Bitcoin numerous times, but never thought to properly look into it.

2022-03-28,"If you really wanted to tax billionaires, get rid of carried interest loophole, limit how much you can borrow against stock you own, and limit how much executives can be paid in stock compared to salary (ex 1:1 would mean if your salary is $10M, you can only be paid $10M in equity). There’s also seems to be some fuckery with restricted stock units and vesting, but I don’t know enough about that to comment on it."

Sell a quarter of his stock, price plummets, good job, billions of dollars wiped out instantly.  It's unsustainable.  I'm all for realized gains tax on rich, they must pay their fair share, but it has to be done responsibly and reasonably."

2022-03-28,"I'm willing to put some money down that this ""20% tax the rich"" will fuck the middle class instead"

That was an insane amount back then. Today you can make well over 250k as a director or practitioner in tech or in sales.

This is why I prefer to use wallets that can be generated offline on a fresh install of a computer. That way no malware or keyloggers could potentially have harvested your keys.   


An interesting technicality: someone else could find the same wallet as you and have access to your funds. The reason why this never happens is in the sheer number of available wallets - the number of potential hiding places for your treasure chest is so unfathomably large.

2021-04-23,"YOU ARE USING MARKET CAP INCORRECTLY. 
Changing the market DOES NOT change the price.

YOU CANNOT USE MARKET CAP AS A WAY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE PRICE WILL BE - You can’t do that because the market cap IS what the value of the total supply is at the current cost. 

YOU CANT CHANGE ADD OR DECREASE MARKET CAP TO GET A DIFFERENT VALUE - you can only change the price and supply. 

ALSO MARKET CAP DOES NOT = DOLLARS IN THE SYSTEM

You’re also not understanding how little supply increase actually affects things. The supply of Dogecoin is NOT infinite. to have an infinite supply you need infinite time. It take 24 YEARS for the supply of Dogecoin to double.

The price and supply change the market cap - completely different. 



Economically speaking Dogecoin can rise to whatever value the market dictates based off of supply and demand. As long as demand out paces the supply then the value will rise. 

I will take your point and explain it correctly. 

I also see people asking what’s stopping Dogecoin from going to bitcoin levels? Well, The short answer is the supply of Dogecoin is high relative to the supply of bitcoin. Dogecoin has a current supply of 128 billion, which is why the price is lower and harder to change in value. It is easier for bitcoin to rise $1 in price because the supply of bitcoin is so low and the supply of Dogecoin is so high.  It doesn’t mean that Dogecoin can’t rise in price - just that it’s harder. 

This is the long answer.
First, It is important to note that demand does not necessarily equate to adding dollars to the system in 1 to 1 ratio. Demand can increase without ever having to add money into the system, however, adding new money into the system does help. I see people saying Dogecoin requires X million dollars per minute to account for the increase in supply. That is just completely wrong, and not how demand works. Increased Demand just means more people willing to trade Dogecoin at a higher price than people willing to trade at the current price. No net increase in fiat currency needs to be added in order for demand to increase. 

Despite not having a capped supply, using the current supply known, as well as the mining rate to account for new coins entering - you can make comparisons to other cryptocurrency to get an idea of the demand required in order for Dogecoin to reach a certain price.  The way to do this is through market cap comparisons 

Mathematically speaking market cap = price multiplied by supply
MC (Market Cap) = P (Current Price) x S (Current Supply)

Before moving forward, I want to explain market cap and the misconceptions behind its as well as how to correctly use it. 

Market cap just means how much the total supply is “valued/worth” at a certain price. The exact definition applies to stocks; not cryptocurrency how ever for our purposes the mathematics still apply.
I see people saying how Dogecoin has a current market cap of $X billion market cap and what the market cap needs to be for Dogecoin to be $1 is $128 billion. Then they say if 100 million people put $1000 in doge then doge will = $1.

THAT’S NOT HOW MARKET CAP WORKS.

*MARKET CAP DOES NOT MEAN TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE SYSTEM - A 6 billion dollar market cap does not mean there’s 6 billion dollars in the system. It means that the entire supply is “worth” 6 billion at the current price. When I originally wrote this people got confused so I wanted to clarify that. Market cap is a comparison tool that I use in this example to show how Dogecoin would look at each price point*

Simply adding money to the system does absolutely nothing to affect market cap in the same way it does not necessarily change the price/demand. The only two variables that change the market cap are price and supply nothing else can change the market cap. 

Market caps REAL use is a comparison tool. It’s used to compare how successful a market is compared to other markets. 

If Dogecoin were to reach $1 today it would have a market cap of about 128 billion dollars ($1 x 128,495,957,919 circulating supply). Bitcoin (the most successful cryptocurrency) currently has a market cap of approximately $898,761,019,333 (~ $900 billion). This means that at $1, the total supply of Dogecoin would be “worth” about 1/7th of Bitcoins total supply. 

The take away from this comparison is that in order to reach $1 Dogecoin would require approximately 1/7th the current demand of bitcoin due to the differences in supply between Dogecoin and bitcoin. This is definitely not impossible, and an achievable goal. If Dogecoin were to reach the demand bitcoin has currently - its price would $7. Since bitcoin is the highest performing cryptocurrency, $7 dollars is the most realistic possible goal at current market conditions. Anything past $7 dollars per coin means that Dogecoin is reaching uncharted territory for cryptocurrency as it will have surpassed bitcoin.

Now for the hypothetical extension of this comparison. Everything after this point is hypothetical since we don’t have a true comparison available in the market

The estimated supply of the US dollar is about $2,000,000,000 (2 trillion), thus the market cap of the US currency is $2 trillion. If Dogecoin were to reach the equivalent market cap ($2tn / $128bn), the price per Dogecoin would have to be $15.60, thus matching the entire short-term US currency (M0 money supply in economics).

This is definitely not impossible, but it is highly highly improbable to reach such value any time soon. If that were to ever happen, it would take years. Now, the entire supply of the entire worlds fiat (short-term liquidity / paper) currency is $37 trillion. You can apply the same logic from above and see that the value of Dogecoin would have to be $288.60. If it was valued any higher than that amount, Dogecoin would be ""worth"" more than the entire world’s short-term liquidity currencies combined. It could technically go past this point, but what that would mean is that the economy behind Dogecoin would be stronger than the entire global economy of today. At that value you wouldn’t even compare it to the dollar anymore because it already surpassed all fiat currency. It’s not impossible- but is is highly unrealistic to pass that point. It is important to note that this number is not static. Which means if the market conditions change such as an increase in supply or change in price the numbers will change."

>Why is this important? It reduces the possibility of a rugpull to almost zero, especially if the dead coins wallet is over 50%.  


This is not necessarily a good sign. Every single shitcoin being created every minute does that because the devs aren't losing anything by doing it. When the tokens are burnt, they are effectively worth 0 (before being added to the liquidity pool). 

And this actually benefits scammers, because it masks the top holders real percentage (if i have 3% of the supply, but 50% of the total supply is burnt, I actually have 6%). 

Now, a high percentage of tokens burnt afterwards, such as in deflationary currencies...That is bullish ofc. (One of my shitcoins went from 50% to 65% supply burnt in the first 10 days, that's super good)"

* Even if you want to make quick buck, given the coin you bought has some utility or has some long term plans of staying, you just sell it again when it reaches the previous pump high

This helps you in 2 ways -   Limit your loss incase the coin goes bust; Maximise your multiplier for money (Say you buy a coin after it dips from 0.005 to 0.001 and you sell it back at 0.005, you multiply your money by 5 times Whereas if you bought it at 0.0025, you only double your money)

**The key point is don't FOMO buy near the highs thinking 'The price will never come down' - If not this coin, there are plenty others to flip money at**

&#x200B;

is also a naive, though predictable, response to market volatility. We all know an uncle, brother, coworker, hairdresser etc. that talks about how they made a killing on bitcoin or something. What we never hear about are the consistent bad or aggressively average investments they made as well. We remember our own big wins at the expense of forgetting the patterns that consistently find us on the wrong sides of trades.   


It's confirmation bias, is my point  


When people post things like ""paper handed bitches"" it's because in their own mind they can't admit anything about being wrong. They're on the wrong side of a trade, they're irrational and emotional, so it has to be something outside their own insight that they blame, in this instance other investors. It's saying ""I was right about this until they messed it up""

&#x200B;

Investors, especially if they're new, need to be very careful about sticking to their own plan and analysis. Example: I think DOGE has significant room to run with a price target at $2. I could be very wrong. I bought (relatively) low. Price skyrocketed, people cheered. Price just sank, everybody is whining about 'paper hands'. My own reasoning hasn't been invalidated, I still think it has the $2 price target. I'm not worried about other people selling because it's irrelevant to the drivers that I believe will move the price. Could I be wrong? absolutely. Is this slide downward proof that I'm wrong? Sure might be, who knows. My strat was to hold from $0.07 for a few years. That doesn't get invalidated by significant volatility now, and it sure as hell isn't the 'fault' of paper hands

&#x200B;

TLDR, yelling ""paper hands"" is an emotional reaction when you're doubting your own strategy."

As if we're all too stupid to understand the risks. It's crazy. 

Before I sometimes doubted whether the world really needed decentralized assets and marketplaces. Whether the advantages of crypto were really worth the current valuation.

No longer. Now I'm absolutely sure we need crypto, DeFi and preferably an entirely decentralized internet. The world needs a decentralized space that can not be overregulated or censored by governments or other entities. Not saying that regulation is always bad, but I think we desperately need a space where you can be truly free. Where you can not be censored and where you can keep some assets away from big entities that will hopefully always have your best interest at heart and not just those of their biggest sponsors"

4. Wash trading - trading amongst themselves when buy orders were disabled and tanking the price

So we have market manipulation, possible corruption and collusion between various players against retail investors who outsmarted hedge funds

The guy who started this went in with $50k knowing he is going against billions of dollars. His closing position yesterday was $50m and he is still holding

This is so wrongheaded it's not funny. You should not be relying on a volatile speculative investment to ""get out of the gutter"". It's like buying lottery tickets.

There's no problem with people who can afford the losses taking a risk by pumping GME, or buying obscure coins. That said, if you are counting on the money it should not be invested, nevermind in a volatile holding.

Actually that brings me around to the REAL problem with Crypto**currency**. No-one actually buys crypto to use as a currency. It's a speculative investment people buy to hold on the chance it will be worth something someday. Honestly at present it serves no purpose to justify it's valuation except for the gamble that someday people other than cartels and rogue states will use it as a currency and it will have some actual value."

The service, which PayPal revealed it was working on late last year, will be available at all of its 29 million merchants in the coming months, the company said.

2021-03-30,"TLDR (only a three minute read but still....)

* PayPal will allow U.S. consumers to use their cryptocurrency holdings to pay at millions of its online merchants globally.
* The move could significantly boost use of digital assets in everyday commerce.
* Customers who hold bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash and litecoin in PayPal digital wallets will now be able to convert their holdings into fiat currencies at checkouts.
* The service will be available at all of its 29 million merchants in the coming months."
2021-03-30,"I'm sure I'll get downvoted for this, because it's not bullish...

But a reminder that crypto held on paypal is *not real crypto*.  Paying to any of these merchants using crypto is NOT PAYING WITH CRYPTO.  

Paypal does NOT LET YOU WITHDRAW CRYPTO.  Literally the only thing you do can do is give paypal your money, and they will hold your money for you.  You can not send it to anyone you want.  You can not hold it in your own wallet.  It is not censorship resistant.  It is not decentralized.

All this ""feature"" is doing is selling the crypto paypal holds and sending it to a merchant using paypal's already-existing fiat-denominated transfer.  This does not enable any new crypto transactions with paypal - it's just a headline to try and convince you to give paypal your money.  It does not advance crypto in any way.

So please, stop being fooled.  Stop posting about paypal - they've been one of the biggest roadblocks to crypto adoption since the start."

2022-04-13,So how do i get in on the inside track?🤔
2022-04-13,And this only gets public because this is crypto. Now imagine what such people do on the fully intransparent traditional financial markets.
2022-04-13,Someone please correct me if I’m wrong but doesn’t Coinbase need to have a reserve of each crypto listed.. therefore couldn’t it just be Coinbase purchasing the reserve of the coins they are listing?
2022-04-13,That's why you stay away from any newly listed coin. You can lose money later with the same coin when it's well established
2022-04-13,Thats trash and gives more ammo for over regulation.  Stay classy coinbase

2022-04-13,"That is how it works in 99% of exchanges, insiders know the exchange is going to list the coin, they buy before listing and dump when the coin is listed. If you check some alt coins history, the first day price usually went crazy high."

2021-05-13,"If it helps anyone. I was down on my initial investment about 90% 1-2 years ago. I didn't do anything. Wouldn't even look at prices. Still haven't done anything at all. And now I'm up 600%. Even after the dip.

I watched a YouTube video, don't have the link, in which Warren Buffet talks about the great depression. Those who sold during the depression, which is warranted given that it was the depression, lost almost everything. Those who held for 10-20 years not doing anything made a huge profit. I can't say that this is the same thing, but so far the investment strategy of not doing anything at all has worked for me.

*I should also mention that I did a lot of research on the projects that I held. I recognized their potential in the long term, and they are all projects that have continued to develop and achieve their long term goals. I made mistakes early on and got hit by exchange transfer fees, gas fees, and icos. Lost some money in the process. This is another reason I decided to just not do anything. It's too expensive to be jumping around right now."
2021-05-13,"It's a scary thing seeing your portfolio turn red for the first time. Most will learn that it's part of the rollercoaster that is cryptocurrency and learn to enjoy it or become numb to it. Eventually, if you stay long enough it's just green though, at least one hopes so 😅"
2021-05-13,"Just actively discouraging loss-porn is a great start. New money is mostly coming from the stock market so the idea that crypto is to be 'traded' in a similar fashion is normal. 
Patiently educating newbies about cryptocurrencies and the pros/cons of frequently moving value back to fiat will help them recognize non vs operating assets on their own."
2021-05-13,"In general, I think this sub is pretty helpful. There are always a few bad eggs, but most people seem to try to help the noobs."
2021-05-13,"Agreed. And apparently I can't post from this account yet, so here was a post on the same subject I was attempting to make for some newcomers:

\----

Impressed with the support levels after the drop. Couple reminders for the newcomers:-The bigger the green run, the bigger the drop. This is consolidation and it's very helpful for long term stability. The new support forming here is considerably higher than the last.

\-Do you think the 2021 bull run is over? General predictions would assume its length would be longer than 2017, setting new ATHs across the board. We're certainly not there yet. These 20% drops shake off weak hands, and create a new strong psychological entry point for investors.

\-Have you noticed all your friends/family starting to ask about crypto and find out how to get in? If you were here by now, you're still early enough to enjoy more of this run.

With ALL that said, and with plenty of confidence from this 8 year crypto investor that this run has a lot of fuel left, these are the most important things to remember:

\-Don't invest anything you can't afford or anything you need soon. Patience wins out in crypto, and if you sell in the red or buy in the green you're making it infinitely more difficult on yourself.

\-Don't be afraid to take some profits. Have a coin that just went up 400% in the last couple months? Sell 25% of your shares. Now you're just investing house money, and when a big correction comes you'll have cash for it. I just rode ETC from $6 to $175, but sold 10% every $50 up. Now I've made back a great profit, still have my ETC, and am ready to buy more today. Occasional and incremental profits make these red days seem like a beautiful discount and another opportunity to build your ideal crypto portfolio.

\-DIVERSIFY! First off, diversify with other investments. Crypto shouldn't be more than 20% of your investment portfolio in my opinion (I said 10% in 2017 and I'll probably say 30% in a few years). But diversify within crypto. We're getting into the trenches of this bull run, and you're going to start seeing some crazy gains on random coins soon. Better to have your chips in a lot of places so you're less exposed to any one drop, but a part of all the spikes you care about. But when you diversify...

\-Don't invest in shit coins. Do your research. If you invest in good tech, you'll win long term typically. If you invest in meme coins, not only are you exposing yourself to a 99% loss, you're also hurting the long term sustainability of crypto in general. As someone who profited greatly from the last bull run, but ended up getting burned with an over-investment in Fun Fair during the crash, trust me. Even when the moon runs seem tempting, it's not worth it (that one was $.005 to $0.20 and right back down.)

\-Always keep money aside for the next bear market. If you do, you'll be thrilled at those prices long term. If you don't you'll panic. I sold 350,000 ADA at $.02 and 50 Ethereum @ $400. Had I taken out even 10% of my profits initially I would've been in a much better position to be a buyer than a seller. Learn from my mistakes - if you believe in the tech, plan for the future, but don't limit yourself for tomorrow.

Anyways, just some thoughts on a red day. I remember lots of days like these were stressful for me years back, and now they're oddly comforting. But if you follow the basic principles you have a great opportunity to profit in the short term and thrive in the long term.

Good luck to you all (and stop burning money in Doge)"
2021-05-13,Just tell them to buy the dip with their infinite amount of cash.   It seems like everyone always “buys the dip” every time.
2021-05-13,"this is true, we should strive to help ""newbies"" understand that there are risks involved and it's not magic like some influencers try to sell it"
2021-05-13,"I must say I often read posts like this, but at least in this sub I do think more than 95% of people are always kind and willing to help."
2021-05-13,"People are just always mean to newcomers to anything for some reason. Everyone should use their wisdom to help others not be jerks to people who don’t know something you learned.

2021-05-13,"It all gets so blown out of proportion. People, not just newbies, freaking out about the ""market crashing"" when it's not crashing which only freaks other people out. I get annoyed by the ""sky is falling posts"". Life is filled with peaks and valleys. Everyone needs to expect that, and that is what they signed up for - a rollercoaster ride. I get sick of hearing about the fake crash, and it does become exhausting having to hold people's hand. I am not a heartless person, actually quite the opposite, but those people signed up for this ride, and it's been more of a kiddie ride than a terrifying roller coaster. As a whole the market is doing fabulous."
2021-05-13,Shaking up noobs to dump their holdings so people can buy it at a discount is the oldest trick in the book.
2021-05-13,my crypto portfolio has slowly eclipsed my stocks in value and seeing it dip really only signalled a good time to buy. It’s a whole different mindset you have to be in.
2021-05-13,Shall I invest my life savings to CUMROCKET and SHIBA coins now?
2021-05-13,"I'm really new here and I'm just assuming that crypto is a scam and my money is already gone. So why not just hold forever, right?

I jest, of course. To your point, I've found this sub to be a very even mix of people who are helpful and people who are easily annoyed at the new people. I get the annoyance though, as it often looks like it's directed towards either questions that are very easy to answer with a quick Google or questions asking for direct buy/sell advice.

I'm here because I'm making crypto a part of a larger investment strategy, and I'm bringing my ""research -> buy -> hold"" attitude with me. I hope to be here for a while, and a dip or two or ten isn't a huge issue."
2021-05-13,"I think its a reaction to paper hands that trigger folks.  You really need to have strong conviction in order to make profits in crypto and any type of investments.  

People need to understand that volatility is not the same as risk.  You can have equally volatile coins but one is risker than the other.

I'm relatively new to crypto but yes this group needs to be mentors to our new community members if we want to instill sound and reasonable ways to investing in crypto.

I really think a separate tab in the main area for new members to the cryptoverse would help alleviate harsh reactions to new members.  Education is key.  New members are just reacting based on their fears and emotions which is totally normal.  We all do that but it doesn't help in the investing world."
2021-05-13,"No  we preach and preach to DYOR and nobody fucking does it. They think DYOR means read the top trending hashtag and dump your weekly allowance all in.

Stupid should hurt."
2021-05-13,"Yeah there are kind of a lot of assholes in here tbh. But what can ya do, that's the internet. 

On the other side of that coin, it's probably annoying to some when they see the same kinds of questions and posts over and over and over. I personally think you're right but that's just how it is. Assholes don't generally stop being assholes"

I am also willing to wager that this move from Nayib Bukele may be a factor that reduces future violence and crime in El Salvador.

EDIT: As someone else in this thread has mentioned already, this move may also have been made to dodge sanctions that the Biden administration is considering putting on Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras altogether - https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/exclusive-us-targets-central-america-officials-possible-sanctions-over-2021-05-05/

The president of el salvador is very serious about attracting crypto talent to his country.               

EDIT: From what I have read here - if you are American and you want to get a permanent residence in el salvador, you will likely need to stay in the country at least three years first - https://www.globalization-partners.com/globalpedia/el-salvador-employer-of-record/work-visas/"

So if 10 billion is removed it causes bigger swings but when the stock market drops 10 billion it’s another Tuesday.

2021-12-05,I don't trust tether. That's why I keep all my funds in dog tokens.
2021-12-05,"The problem is really on the CEXs.

If you are P2P, wallet to wallet, you can't invent anything. 

Take Metamask for example... You can FIAT fund that (buy ETH) and trade that ETH with a counterparty. No bullshit. 

With a CEX though they can receive your FIAT deposit (thanks for the USD) and give you USDT (magic money). You can take that magic money and do all kinds of things within that CEX. You can, theoretically, create USDT, buy Bitcoin, sell Bitcoin, return USDT, and make a profit.

That is called synthetic leverage and it shouldn't exist in Crypto. The whole thesis behind Crypto/Bitcoin is there is limited supply. It is a scarce resource. But the CEX's are basically the new banks and they allow all this trading within their ecosystem which introduces synthetic leverage and dilution. 

The price of Bitcoin CAN and like IS artificially inflated by USDT sitting on CEXs. 

Stablecoins are the life blood of Crypto and there are some that have better transparency/auditing than others... I think USDC is more legit... But we absolutely need stablecoins. 

Here's a sort of hint into how absolutley fucked things are on Binance (the largest exchange in the world). 

The maximum daily deposit is $200,000 USD. The maximum daily withdrawal is $200,000 USD. 

If you had, $10,000,000 USD in assets... It would take you 50 days to withdraw your money. In the event of some kind of systemic panic, you would be fucked.

You CAN transfer up to 60 bitcoin in/out per day (notional value of $3M. So the limitation on the FIAT is not some kind of KYC limitation. 

The reason they have this limitation is because IF EVERYBODY started transferring out from USDT to USD they would have a bank run and be fucked - they are doing some kind of fractional reserve banking. 

This is why I hold no coins in CEXs... If there is some kind of fraud revealed then everyone will try to withdraw USD and transfer their coins and you will not be able to. Binance is totally unregulated, incorporated off an East African island... We're totally due for a massive scandal and maybe that will be the catalyst for the next 80% drop. 

Unfortunately there won't be any coin that will escape a USDT fallout, even other legit stables will get un-pegged."

The report reveals that every year between 2014 and 2017, over $77 million passed through the Aussie banks. Once in Australia, the money was used to purchase electronic items such as laptops, gaming consoles, smart devices, digital cameras and other electronic gadgets.

2021-02-23,It's getting close to 20%. That's not uncommon at all for BTC. What is alarming is the velocity of this dip. The crypto community is the loudest echo chamber I've ever been in. We need to be cautious that we aren't falling for our own sales pitch.

2021-05-23,"This is the worst thing to do if you are invested in altcoins. Even if the fundamentals are awesome there is always the danger of a swap happening that has a deadline. For example Enigma (ENG) was a coin in the Top 50 which had a swap because of some legal issues and is now Secret (SCRT). They had a deadline of half a year for a swap. People lost thousands of dollars because they followed this stupid advice and never checked the news of their coins.   


IF you are invested in any altcoins that are below top 10 of CMC, ALWAYS check for updates once in a while or you could lose your complete investment."

But you should still check coin related stuff for your coins once in a while. I've seen it at least four times that a coin switched from the ETH network to a mainnet or changed blockchains and the window to convert the coins was closed after a while.

2021-05-18,"Been in Vechain since 2017. A project with real world use cases.. It's one of the reason I prefer to be invested in this over ADA. 

Too bad today's hype involves dogs and safe or moon whatsoever. It's a matter of time for this gem."
2021-02-07,"it's a safe bet that if you're not already in dogecoin for this pump, its too late and not worth the risk."
2021-02-07,"I can’t believe that over a week into all this that today, doge is 0.07. 

I really hope it works out for these puppies, but it’s hard not to feel like I’m watching a train that’s about to crash *hard*."
2021-02-07,"When/If it eventually dumps this entire subreddit is just going to be joking about it.  Then the next things.  It'll cycle eventually, but the amount of shilling that has been happening the past days have been nuts."
2021-02-07,"As a newbie I'm trying to understand. If doge is so flawed, and there is an endless amount etc.. Why does it even have a value? And why has that value continuously been going up? 

If it's all hype, what's going to stop it? Elon won't stop tweeting about it, celebrities won't stop being fomo'd into it, Twitter won't stop with the memes. So what will stop it?

This isn't a defense, it's genuine curiosity by someone who doesn't understand and is getting terrible fomo while his friends are making money."
2021-02-07,"I mean, yea. It's clearly not a good investment, but I just double-checked my math and I'm pretty sure 1 doge = 1 doge"
2021-02-07,"I remember owning 6 million Doge back in 2014 when it was tipped on the Dogecoin subreddit like crazy. So much fun. Does anyone remember all the charity that was made possible thanks to Doge? The Nascar race with the Doge logo all over, or the Jamaican bobsled team who was funded thanks to Doge?   
I traded my DOGE for DARKcoin back, which later rebranded to DASH. The same FUD on Doge was shared back then, which made me trade everything for DASH. Funny, how Doge has outperformed DASH since then.   
To get good gains nowadays, you need to find projects which actually solve some of the issues we have with cryptocurrencies.   
DIVI solves a lot of the entry barriers to crypto, and has made masternode setups extremely, easy, just to name an example of a project that actually aims at solving a problem, the same way LINK solves the ""oracle problem""."
2021-02-07,"I hate this pump as much as the next guy and I don't own doge, but I think what people forget is: because the block amount is fixed, in the long run the currency inflation rate will decrease significantly.

In 2020, doge's total supply went from ~122 billion to ~127 billion (4.09% supply increase)

In 2021, it will go from ~127 to ~132 (3.9% supply increase)

Given that the total US Dollar supply (in m1) rose ~35% in 2020, fiat is still TOTAL crap compared to dogecoin.

Its technology is not the best at all and so many cyrrency-type coins have much more to offer (btc, ltc, xmr, nano, etc) but people forget just how bad fiat is. If the USD could make it with a 35% supply increase in 2020, the main problem with doge will *not* be their *decreasing* ~4% supply increase/year."
2021-02-07,"I’m mean, don’t get me wrong, I agree to an extent. Mostly because of how out of nowhere the popularity of dogecoin can be. But I had almost 300k doge back around the whole nascar thing and people were saying the same stuff you said in this post. 

My $100 investment would be worth over $20k if I still had it."

2021-02-07,"I keep hearing this, but why is the price constantly increasing then? Are the exchanges & CMC slow at updating the circulating supply?

Surely the cash flow into Doge can not be this absurd? If I look at Bitfinex for example the 24h volume on MDOGE/USD isn't anywhere close to the bigger currencies and usually when a pump like this occurs the currency pumping is usually ALWAYS at the top. Is it one man with infinte money just pumping this alone or what gives?"

Honestly, this just made me want to bet on the underdog(e). It took me a while to figure out why dogecoin isn't the same as bitcoin, but it was not thanks to the people here. So many doge holders don't hold much, if they lose it all, they're going to want to know how to do it right next time. Don't be a dick."

2021-04-19,"I whole-heartedly agree with OP. For a community with such a huge desire and investment in public acceptance of crypto, making a person that really wants to learn feel like a piece of crap only furthers you from your goals. On the contrary, people with fluid knowledge of the subject should be lining up to answer these beginner questions! Can a lot of the answers be found here with a cursory search? Maybe, but it could be that the noob in question doesn't know the terminology to search for or how to ask the question. Other times, it may just take the right person phrasing the answer a certain way for the info to click. To assume noobs are lazy or dumb or don't deserve to invest in crypto serves no one except the fragile egos of those doing the belittling."

2021-05-19,"To be fair Bitcoin will likely surge back to its pre-today levels. It has done this boom bust cycle several times by now. It's why it is considered a volatile investment. It's also historically been a cycle. Crypto winter of 2017 lasted years, but eventually Bitcoin eclipsed its previous highs. Con, but also Pros.

HODL is just one strategy for investment.

There are others as well. 

Dollar cost average

Sell portions at a time when you've made x% of profit to lock in cash

Sell all when you make X profit.

Sell when there are drops of X%

The point is, HODL may not always work for you. If you need the money that's allowed. If you're not into Bitcoin for the dream, that's allowed. If you want to wait 5 years to see what happens to your investment, that's allowed. Anyone trying to convince you that their pattern is the ONLY correct one is either dumb or smart enough to have a strategy you may not be aware of.

It's a fact that they go after the common class and ignore the rich because they can defend themselves with money. We're already in this situation where being rich you only get richer and being poor, you're only getting poorer. As the lower class you have to deal with getting less and less value from your pay every time the inflation increases, whereas the rich can even avoid taxes without anyone coming after them. What do you expect? People let things get to this point by undervaluing themselves like idiots, and acception that whatever the government does is fine. Just look at what age you have to retire compared to what age politicians may retire.

The government won't do anything as long as people accept those things. And why would they? They're only becoming richer, so everything works out for them. Meanwhile, you can't even voice your opinion.

People will jump at you and shut you up saying you know nothing, not then realizing that they're hurting themselves too with that ignorance. From my experience, this will likely get downvoted. People don't like hearing the truth, but whatever. I'm starting to not care anymore about all this political crap, and likely many other are starting to feel the same when they get the same experience. The rich are getting what they wanted and the poor masses of sheeps are getting what they're accepting.

2021-03-06,"If you become rich off of crypto and you have nothing to do all day, you can try reinvesting that money into crypto and you'll miss the days when you had nothing to do all day."
2021-03-06,"I think your problem wasn't being rich, but being alone. You mentioned that your wife died, you didn't mention any good friends but just people looking for your money. Money can buy everything but can't buy love.

I'm sure if your wife was still alive, you would enjoy traveling all year around the world, going to cool places, buying everything you want.

However now you seem somehow happy so I'm sure you agree that it's better to do what you do now and having a lot money than working all day long.


If I'll even get rich, I would probably open my own business, so I would actually keep working, but not for someone else."
2021-03-06,"I'm working towards my financial freedom. I'm in my thirties and this is definitely something I've thought about. How to spend my time when working isn't something I have to do and so far I've had no issues with coming up with activities that I have very limited time for currently: Music, coding projects, game development, photography, running a marathon or two, hiking in all the places I've always wanted to,... The list goes on. 

If I can stay healthy, I have a feeling that I might actually need another lifetime instead of worrying about boredom. At least the Covid lockdown has been a good experience for a worst case scenario and even then I've not ran out of things to do."
2021-03-06,"My youngest son had me buy 5 Bitcoins @ $300 each. I’m in my 60’s and still don’t know what to think about this phenomenon. I retired from my own company almost 10 years ago. My sons run it now. I’ve got cars, homes, boats and bla bla bla but my wife died in 97 and I’d give everything I got for just another day with her."
2021-03-06,"I haven't worked in a few years either, I don't really call myself retired though as I'm only 30.  I spend most of my time reading, gaming, and helping friends and family.  I've never had a problem with boredom though, and I think it's cause of something my mom said when I was a kid, ""only boring people get bored"".  There's so many beautiful things out there to experience and see, or you can create something, there's always something to do if you open your eyes to the world around you.  Money doesn't buy you happiness, but it definitely buys you freedom.  And freedom is pretty amazing, if you embrace it."

2021-03-06,"Most people just want enough money to achieve the dream they were promised by society as children:

1) Own a house.
2) Own a car.
3) Be able to take vacations every year.
4) Be financially stable enough to have children.
5) Not live paycheck to paycheck.
6) Possibly be free of major debts.

I don't want to be rich, I just want those things. But the American economic system is fucked up and they're almost impossible to attain even with a college education and well paying job. We were sold a dream by the boomers and then they made it absurdly difficult for us to achieve it.

I just want to break free from some of these fucking chains."

2021-03-06,I'm so looking forward to the day I'll be bored because my wealth will allow me to.
2021-03-06,"I semi retired for a few years while caring for some ill relatives.  What I started doing (and continue to this day) is pick something to learn every year.  One year it was firearms.  The next it was ham radio.  Then stock charting.  The tarot cards.  Then wood working.

I am sixty and I love learning new, odd stuff.   If you are retired, no one pays attention to you.  Find something—anything—to occupy your time.  Sitting on your ass letting the world go by is bad for your health."
2021-03-06,Honestly if I got rich I would still keep my current job but only give the bare minimum to not be fired.
2021-03-06,I'm glad you found going back to college and learning is worth it. I think I might just do that when I'm older as well. The learning never should stop 😌.
2021-03-06,Hobbies golfing and helping close friends occupy my time now. People don’t realize how hard it is to not work. What a problem to have though could be worse
2021-03-06,"It is a good point. What's all that money if you don't know what do do with it. If you plan on getting rich, better have a plan for when you get rich."
2021-03-06,"I understand what you're feeling. My investments did very well last year, and my Fiance and I were so excited making plans to buy a car, buy our first house, travel the world. All very big things for us seeing as we had been homeless since we met in 2017. Sadly she relapsed on Heroin last October and i found her dead in the bathroom. Ive been lost and just wandering since then. I bought the car, i got a nice apartment instead of a house, and ive still got quite alot of money, but it doesnt seem to matter anymore. My plans for it are gone and i dont have a clue what i should be doing or what i want to be doing.  Im sorry to hear about your wife.

2021-05-22,Banks suck. That's why I keep all my cash and bitcoins in the mattress.
2021-05-22,Eff BoA. I recommend putting your cash in a credit union if you can
2021-05-22,They don’t want you to be able to buy the dip obviously.
2021-05-22,Is that why I got my Wendy's for free? They said their computers went down so they couldn't charge me.
2021-05-22, My brother called me today bitching about his bank. They said the exact same thing. The computers were down all day and they would only let him take out $1000. His bank is a local credit union though. Seems odd that it would happen on the same day and  have the same withdrawal limit.
2021-05-22,Canadian here. I have issues with TD Canada Trust from time to time. Paid off my credit card but instead of the money going against the balance TD added that amount to my balance owing so it looked like I charged that amount to my card. On paper it looks like I lost double my money - sum comes out of my account and my td credit card gets that debt added as well. This has happened more than once and TDs response is basically “oh it’s a glitch”. They don’t care at all and never announce that they are having issues with their system and tell me “we are sorry you had a bad experience” Damn right I had a bad experience and had to call you chuckleheads to get it corrected (plus listen to that shit on hold music). I wonder how many others this happens to.
2021-05-22,In 2008 after horror after horror being a Bank of America customer decided to call it quits and I couldn’t be happier. This news confirms my decision. I just will not ever go back there - so many choices and better options.

2021-08-15,"In other news:

r/CryptoCurrency again has nothing to do but suck Elon’s dick then complain that this sub is full of Elon’s tweets"
2021-08-15,"I'm not a fan of either Cuban or Musk but we should actually take a moment and think about what they are actually saying instead of knee jerking hating because Musk + Cuban + Dogecoin = hot garbage.  

Almost every Crypto out there is a store of value asset.  Even the ones that are designed to be a currency are not being used as a currency.  People hold these assets because they expect them to appreciate in value.  A medium of exchange coin is something that can easily be exchanged for fiat and is widely accepted by merchants.  Because Dogecoin is basically Bitcoin source code, it has a ton of development and acceptance basically built in.  They are basically saying Dogecoin isn't an investment its a currency.  Maybe there are objectively ""better"" currencies but I can't really think of anything that has anywhere near the adoption of Dogecoin.  XRP, NAno, sure they are great and have low fees but no one actually uses them as a currency.   Maybe instead of instantly hating Dogecoin we should be excited about any adoption of any Crypto? 

Maybe we should be less concerned about gatekeeping Crypto and more concerned about actually seeing some adoption?"

2021-08-15,"For the record, the clients of Cuban's businesses are choosing Doge, which accept ANY crypto. This is based off statistical data, of what people choose to pay with. Because it's inflationary, it actually encourages people to spend it as a currency, rather than save it as a store of value. It may not be the best designed cryptocurrency for this application either, sure, but people are certainly using it that way.

2021-08-15,Posts like this remind me how mental and clueless the crypto community is.
2021-08-15,The DOGE loves a FOMO tweet
2021-08-15,"disregarding this being about DOGE, I do not understand how any coin that has a so volatile value can be the best medium of exchange. I'd rather use a stable coin, such as USDC, or even better OUSD (the last one is a smart stable, it increases automatically in your wallet through a series of strategies in the background).

I mean, I wouldn't want to use a coin that can change its value drastically in half a day as a medium of exchange, I'd rather be sure it is one that has always the same value, and if it gives me some benefits even better."
2021-08-15,It's because DOGE is rather inflationary for now and it is one of the closest being a fiat in that terms; whilst being a Cryptocurrency (edit) w/ that sort of branding power.

And now he is sour, embarrassed and ashamed.  But won't admit it. So he rages and blames  you for telling him to start dating in the first place .

However, I was really anxious throughout as I wasn't 100% sure. This was in 2017. Since then, I do not give advice to anyone, because of the anxiety."

2021-06-13,"Well, John's stupid, you didn't lose much"

2021-06-13,Moral of the story: there are very few people that you should give investment advice to
2021-06-13,"Let me present a different view than the harsh Darwinist take most in here have on this. 

You introduced a slow person to something complex and rife with risk. Now it unsurprisingly went sideways and he doesn’t have the mental capacity to properly handle it, which leads him to treat you in an immature manner. Honestly, what did you expect? 

Of course, you can now ask yourself if you still want to be friends, but if you do (and many reasons can be valid), you might need to help him through it and financially recover, in order to make things right."

2021-05-21,"Here’s what a good friend of mine who speaks Chinese said after he looked into the Chinese perspective on cryptocurrencies;

background:
- since 2013, Chinese law has not recognized ""cryptocurrencies"" as a form of currency in China (for example, people holding them do not benefit from the legal protections afforded to legally recognized currency in disputes etc). possession of cryptocurrency is not banned.
- since 2017, China has banned businesses within China from issuing ""virtual currency"", or exchanging legal currency and ""virtual currency"", effectively banning ICOs and crypto exchanges based in China (e.g. Binance). usage of foreign exchanges was not banned.

On wednesday, three Chinese industry associations (banking, internet finance, payments & clearing) wrote an announcement:
- declaring that ""virtual currencies"" have no inherent value
- warning about their high instability, risk, and relation to illegal financial activities
- banning their members (basically all banks & financial service providers in China) from providing any services related to ""virtual currencies"" (for example, sending money to crypto exchanges)."

China *allows* Bitcoin to operate. If China wants to fuck shit up, it can. It literally has a million people in ""re-education"" camps right now and the world doesn't do shit about it.

2021-07-05,"Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin to free us from this corrupt system.

This quote from Satoshi Nakamoto explains it all:

>""The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.""

The current system requires that the people can have blind trust in central bankers and private bankers.

History has shown us that this is impossible.

The whole system is corrupt. From the bankers to the rulers.

The people need a currency that empowers them. Bitcoin is our best weapon for that."

The fact is, had this money been put in an actual investment it would have held value. Even something with low interest like a government bond would have worked. If it were put in an index fund then even better.

2021-04-24,"That's by design tho. If a currency doesn't lose value over inflation overtime it hurts spending and less spending = less earned by others. Why would I spend if my dollar in the future would be worth $100. It incentivizes spending or investing. Investing in bonds lends money to the government that is put back into building the country, paying social security (and military too), and investing in stocks gives you a larger risk/reward, but makes things like pensions a thing.

People need to learn basic financial literacy. Cash is meant to be held when you have expenses that are near in the future like a few years. Money you don't need for 10 years is not mean to be held. That's why with cbdc's governments are experimenting expiry dates and stuff (not the sole reason).  

The money would be $420K in buying power back then, but if you invested it in the S&P 500, it would be \~$4.5 Million.

We also have to realize that we aren't dealing with a domestic market, so comparing crypto markets to stock markets doesn't make sense either.

2021-05-06,"Doge has 2 big problems holding it back.

But to begin with the good news; the reason why doge is going up in price is got to do with that people are actually buying, HODLing, and using doge to purchase stuff irl. Well that’s all a currency need to gain value, to be used and accepted as payment. 

Yesterday in South Korea there was more volume in doge trading than in the whole of it’s stock market. That goes to show people who never heard of crypto is buying doge as the first crypto they ever buy, adoption is key.

It’s buying pumping by Elon and the community at this point it’s gained so much attention from news media outlet that anyone with a tv or access to ness is being spammed by their news media with stories about dogecoin as the news media only care about views for ads. I mean ofc Elon can talk about it and more people will know about it but anyone who finds out about dogecoin through Elon Musk is known about it since 2020.

Now to the bad;

Whales 🐳 something like 0.12% percent out of all dogecoin wallets at this point of writing own ~80% of all the dogecoin out there (I mean in the real world and fiat it isn’t much different, the 1% richest have 99% of all the wealth but it isn’t good, two wrongs don’t make one right). 1 wallet if I’m not mistaken owns like 50 billion dogecoins and last it was active was sometime in mid April so those coins are certainly not lost. As a matter of fact last night (EU time) if you were watching the charts you saw a big dip from 0.69 to 0.54 and that was a whale dumping huge amounts of doge but very well calculated amount so that it wouldn’t crash the market.

It’s not the first time whales represent a threat to dogecoin’s bull run. Last time dogecoin tried to go to the moon whales were the reason it all crashed and burn. One could say they’ve learned from that fiasco and “this time is different UwU, but it is what it is. 

EDIT it’s been pointed out in the replies to my comments that RH is the biggest whale, I haven’t done any research on who’s the biggest whale and I’m not too interested in discussing who is the biggest whale so if you want to talk about that please refer to ‘cheeruphumanity’ in my replies.

And lastly 51% attacks is an all present risk with dogecoin, It’s theoretically easy (compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum) to 51% attack Dogecoin to cheat its network to steal coins from others. Some back-of-the-napkin figures crunched by CoinDesk suggest that it would cost roughly $8 million back in February to attack the Dogecoin network for a week (using Antminer L3+ ASICs).

With all that said I own dogecoin and been HODLing for a while now and I wish everyone with dogecoin in their virtual pockets the best of luck and never put more money into it than you can afford to lose, at this point I wouldn’t dare try to guess what prices it can reach but just sit and back enjoy the ride.

2021-05-06,"This is actually and equally large mistake commonly made by crypto people. Assuming marketcap is relevant when its not - it doesnt matter how many tokens/coins are in circulation when entering a bubble, because - well, its a bubble, its driven by emotion and not rationale - and marketcap is a skewed indicator because there isnt a 1:1 relationship between money entering the market and the marketcap $100 worth of Slothcoin at $50,000,000 per coin is actually the same as buying $100,000,000 worth at the same price, it will move the price the same.

And before you get a hizzyfit saying there wouldnt be enough liquidity, so its NOT the same - well, that is exactly my point, marketcap is NOT the real indicator here its liquidity - it takes alot less to move the market at LOW liquidity markets then in a high liquidity, and sell liquidity and buy liquidity is also not the same - so I'm afraid the real answer is much more complex, and actually have very little to do with the circulating supply and marketcap but rather the liquidity.

Price and marketcap really just show the same thing in 2 different ways, what price the last sale at any given moment was made at regardless of the size of the sale - and I can guarantee you that no crypto market right now have the liquidity to support the entire circulating supply.

So is it impossible for those coins to reach those prices? Simple answer is no because it wouldnt require hundreds of trillions entering the market to put the marketcap of a coin at hundreds of trillions, in fact $100 would do if the liquidity was low enough - is it improbable? Yes, but then again in crypto and especially in bull markets improbable things happen all the time..."

The team stopped the network themselves raising questions about centralization
The last transaction block was added more than 3 hours ago.
Sometimes things are too good to be true. Unfortunately, Solana’s parabolic rally and opportunity to create the “flippening” has been short-lived. According to ongoing reports and community complaints on Twitter, the Solana network has not approved or signed any transaction on the blockchain.

&nbsp;

Solana Comes to a Halt

At the time of writing, data from Solscan shows the last transaction was approved and added to the network more than 3 hours ago, suggesting the network outage is recent.

A Twitter announcement from Solana posted at 7:38 AM CST on September 14th noted that Solana is “experiencing intermittent instability,” and the network engineers are working to solve the issues. Moreover, the team followed up with a statement announcing the issue is caused by “resource exhaustion,” which ultimately leads to a denial of service.

&nbsp;

Adjacent services that facilitate the Solana network have also experienced network issues. For example, Arbitrium announced via Twitter that the system was experiencing delays, while Phantom, a Solana wallet, tweeted that they and “other applications are having trouble connecting.”

&nbsp;

Information from August 31st, from NFT project SolanaMees, indicated a similar network issue. RPC providers on Solana were facing intermittent issues as the network rejected PRC requests, which caused them to “go out of sync with the network.”

&nbsp;

On the Flipside

&nbsp;

Solana was experiencing RPC request rejections long before Solana turned off its network

&nbsp;

Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana’s CEO, tweeted to invite Solana validators on the discord server to help amend the issue. Interestingly, Yakovenko suggests the attack is something similar to Ethereum’s Shanghai attack when it experienced DOS.

&nbsp;

Unlike Solana, the Ethereum network did not shut down the network themselves, raising questions about centralization concerns over the network.

2021-11-05,"Welcome to mass adoption, where the most basic use case is gambling.

2021-11-05,"A lot of these coins are all attacking the same Layer 2 solution that ETH needs to reduce friction on transactions. You can think of it as two separate pools of competition moving in parallel.

The first is the tech, which is complex, moves slowly (well, from one perspective... from another, the tech is screaming ahead) and will be driven by adoption of the best solutions. 

The second is the cryptocurrency network effect cycles in the coins. That moves quickly, leverages social networks for hype and movement, and has the dollar signs next to it. 

Guess which one gets more attention from the general public?

Short term traders will use the volatility to capitalize, long term investors will profit off the fundamentals. Same as any other market?"

2021-09-06,"I don't think mass adoption will happen by regular people choosing to use it.

I think it'll happen by industries, systems and use-cases being built on top of blockchains, and people using it without even caring about the underlying technology."

2021-09-06,"So strange to see an actually unpopular opinion on here! I’m glad you posted this though, it’s always good to have different perspectives talked through. It’s a very real possibility that crypto never quite takes off even though we all don’t want that to be the case. That’s one of the risk of investing in this space."

2021-09-06,"If crypto disapeared tomorrow, I dont think it would effect anything at all."
2021-09-06,"At the moment it's too dangerous to implement on a mass scale. People are much further behind with their understanding of tech than a lot of us think. We assume people can use these multiple apps and wallets/swaps etc because we are used to it. The average person will absolutely hate it. I can imagine the calls to my folks already trying to explain it 😅

Also the risk of losing everything instantly and without any way to reverse the transaction is not good. We all know the horror of sending a transaction and waiting for it to go through. 

There's no reason to be mad about that though. Crypto can exist without the mainstream and as its own entity."
2021-09-06,"As others have said, the use cases for crypto transcend finance.

Cryptocurrency is already universal. Most banking transactions do not involve the physical transfer of cash. The issue is decentralized currencies and making the system more efficient. That, I believe, will happen.

Good topic though"
2021-09-06,"Upvoted not because i agree with your opinion, but because it's truly an unpopular one"
2021-09-06,In my opinion Crypto as a currency is not where it's biggest potential lies. Regular money works perfect for most. I think the potential of blockchains with smart contract's are huge tho. There are so many financial instruments that can be automated and done more efficiently with programmable money. And lots of new things (NFTs for example) that can be done (web 3.0). And you want a global decentralized chain for that. Not something a bank or single country controls. Those transactions will still cost gas so the crypto will get huge demand when it's use goes global. These transactions trough the Blockchain will all happen in the background without you even noticing you use it. Kind of like how you don't notice the TCP/IP and html protocols that interact when you visit a website. The mainstream wont be bothered with private keys and addresses

Good luck, you can go to jail for that. Want to do a crypto business, better lawyer up and see if you need to pay millions for a BitLicense.

There is a reason so many crypto websites and exchanges will not take customers from North Korea or New York.

And for all the people saying 'but crypto is decentralized, why do we need a hub?' he's not talking about moving 51% of the mining to New York! He's talking about making it enticing to start crypto related businesses in New York, instead of impossible and illegal as it is now (unless you're a billion dollar wall St. firm)."

2021-10-17,"Tbh I solely relied on this subreddit at first to make some money to put it into crypto. Then I turned to faucets. I grinded all kinds of faucets until I got a couple of dollars and combined with this subreddit I’ve made my 100$.  I started investing with and so far I’m at 400$. I know that 100$ won’t do a thing, but I can’t afford to put any money because I live in Lebanon. In my opinion, if you stick with your plan and hodl all the way through and make the right decisions you’ll make money. Ofcourse it won’t be life changing money but it’s a decent start. You can always try and check other ways of income like drop shipping and co. (This is not financial advice). So therefore, any amount of money works tbh. Especially if you’re under 18 like I am."

2021-10-17,"I agree 100% with this post. However, it should not discourage people from investing in crypto.

In fact, crypto has opened the investing doors for literally anyone. I remember when I was younger that all these people were telling me to invest. INVEST IN WHAT? all I had back then was 500$ in my account!

Now with crypto, you can literally start investing with 10$. Sure, you won't become a millionaire in a week with an investment like that, but the fact that you can start with 10$ without it being a scam speaks volumes.

For more than a 100 years, these rich bastards have been telling us poor people that we can't participate in the investments they make because it's ""too risky"" and it's for ""our protection"". Now, you can invest however much you like and expose yourself to great returns.

We're living in the biggest paradigm shift in the history of humanity and the ones in power do not like it.

Invest in yourself, do your research. If you don't want to be staring at charts 24/7, just use crypto as a saving account and reap your profits from interests.

Not financial advice."

Edit: This happened in April 2020, SOL circulating supply is 300million, and total supply is 500million as of now, this post and the tweets makes it seem as if this happened today, this happened so long ago but just now blew up in this sub but was known by some in r/solana, according to a few replies the SOL team really did secretly create these tokens and purposely hid them and only apologised when caught, take that as you will but it definitely will cause trust issues with the SOL team. Apparently whales still hold a majority of SOL but not 100% on that, and the network did definitely go down for about 17hours with the approval of the validators recently, so it is criticised for being centralised, so bare that in mind

2022-04-07,"I have to visit SF once a year for work.  My last year actually downtown I watched a naked lady sing opera and shit about 10 times dancing in a circle.   This was next to my $300/night hotel for an average place.  Now I stay out in Sonoma at an airbnb for cheaper,  ride in early for work and leave at the end of the day."
2022-04-07,"I live here. This doesn't surprise me at all.

Unfortunately, I think this is the what needs to happen in order for the city to move in the right direction. I work in an industry that was literally shut down by the pandemic. When we were allowed to open up again, we had lost almost all of our business. A huge chunk of our revenue was/is hosting large corporate parties. For the likes of Kraken, Uber, Twitter, Sony, you name it. We've hosted several Crypto companies at our venue. Even though we had been allowed to open, none of the large tech companies had moved back to the city, everyone was still remote. If these tech companies start to leave en mass (or don't come back), we are screwed. Our business model, and in a larger part, *the city's* economic model depend on these tech firms. SF's economy has quite literally been built around the tech industry. When the city first started to reopen, it was a ghost town because the tech firms had remained remote. Officials were panicking trying to find a way to get the tech firms back into the city.

Its a catch 22. The city needs these tech companies to come back to support the economy, but its these same tech companies that have caused the housing crisis, which I don't think anyone would argue isn't a root cause of the homelessness, crime, mental health crisis, drug problem, you name it. I think all of that can be traced back to the insane cost of living. I heard a mind boggling statistic the other day about the homeless in SF. If you've been here long enough, you've heard the homelessness being blamed on other states exporting their homeless population here. The argument being (and maybe this is simply some way to divert blame or denialism), that the homeless population is being imported because we have these stupid fucking laws, or rather a lack of laws, that have decriminalized things like theft. The reality of the situation is that (and here is the statistic) over 90% of the homeless population in SF *became* homeless here. Meaning they were once housed and since living in the city have *become* unhoused. Think about that. Yes, we have a homeless problem that is being exacerbated by decriminalization of things like theft, public urination/deification, trespassing, all of it. But the real problem is that people are *becoming* homeless. Literally losing their homes because of the insane costs of living.

This also isn't just an issue that effects the downtown area or the financial district. Its everywhere. I live in the Outer Richmond, a neighborhood part of town. Its pretty chill and outside of the big downtown area. Recently, the Walgreens closed because of the theft. Driving down Clement street, you'll see people in broad daylight driving down the road, stop in the middle of the street, someone gets out, smashes the window of a nice car, grabs whatever, and simply moves onto the next car. No one bats an eye, cops do nothing. My little family owned local bike shop has been robbed 3 times in the last two months. Cops do nothing, they don't even come to the shop to fill out a report. The little family owned grocery store on the corner has the same people almost every night walk in, grab 2 bottles of wine, walk out, and there is nothing they can do.

Its so fucked.

Its not the tech companies fault. Moving that many high earning individuals to the city so quickly is what has warped the housing market and priced people out. The real blame lies with how the city leadership has reacted. We have no new affordable housing, they refuse to build any, any new development needs an income well over 100k, shit even a renovation demands this much at minimum. We have rent control, but as soon as that lease is up, landlords jack the rent up and price any similar tenant out. These stupid decriminalization laws are just mind mindboggling dumb. Small businesses are closing, retail is leaving, tech is leaving, and the life blood workforce of the city has been priced out by an out of control housing market.

I think a lot of us that live here in the 50-100k range are ready for a crash. I hope the city can figure this out before the tech leaves, but if that's what it takes, so be it. I have 3 roommates, we are all middle earners compared to the rest of the country, and in any other city (sans maybe new york or another huge market) we'd be living alone or own a home. Here, we are technically all under the poverty line, which is 82k. Even if I made 100k a year, living alone is going to cost at least $2000 for a shitty one bedroom, and that's if you can even find. Its insane."

1. The people that hold 90+% of the worlds money.

2. The people that hold 10% or less.

2021-08-04,"Bailouts are anti-capitalistic. With no failure mechanism there can be no capitalism. To big to fail is only a thing so long as those companies are tethered to the American Government via bailouts for bad business endeavors. I understand the idea of protecting jobs and whatnot but at the same time why should corporations that continue to make terrible business decisions continue to get bailed out at the cost of the American taxpayer. Especially since trying to get an initial covid aid relief package out was a fucking nightmare for Congress since it'd go straight to the American people.

How in the hell would the federal government be able to bailout cryptocurrency. If you want to regulate it, then just say that. Don't fucking gaslight the American population by saying something that is just untrue and completely impossible. It's almost like the Democratic Party and Republican Party are two sides of the same coin. Protecting big business, banks and wall street against ways that the little guy can make a buck."

naturally when it comes back up, for some reason, he's now starting to feel like investing on a loan was stupid so he sells at breakeven.

2021-06-12,"For our western brothers and sisters who are curios and oblivious towards Iranian crypto situation:

In Iran, crypto is already essentially legal. If you want to buy or sell crypto you need to sign up with one of the authorized traders [personally I use Nobitex and BitBarg]

It is estimated that about 7 million Iranians are in crypto already.

Mining is also legal but in hot shit right now as Iranian power grid couldn't handle the load and lead to outages and physical damage. Because of this legal mining operations were ordered to shutdown temporarily to ease the power load. However there is lots of illegal mining [power stealing, et al] that the government is fighting against.

Multiple countries actually have mining operations in Iran and the power cost is different for registered miners.

There is some FUD going on and even in the government there is uncertainty towards crypto. Nobody knows what will happen and things can radically change.

There is a crypto foundation in Iran backed by almost all major banks and their dev branches. They have a coin called peyman [PMN]. [Check it out](https://www.kuknos.org/?lang=en)

Following a disaster of a shitshow in Iranian stock market, lots of people are looking into crypto right now. This is of course both a good things and a bad thing as there is lots of misinformation amongst the general public."

It's good BUT I am worried about side effects, even if I have doubts that maybe there is a relation between these activities and Bitcoin price. Why? Imagine you are a superpower country (USA) which you can choose which country can access the International trade market and which country not and you make countries wealthy or poor, and you suddenly understand that you may lose your position when your ""enemies"" are using cryptocurrency to defeat the sanctions, in conclusion, you can't bully the countries."

I will not discuss any other token in this list apart from Safemoon. As that is the one I have spent the time researching. You start this post by stating Safemoon is a scam because you looked in it. You don't give any information on what you looked into. The whitepaper, team, roadmap, AMAs?

&#x200B;

>The idea of naming it ""Safe"" ""moon"" should be a good enough of a red  flag.

You sound like a boomer that doesn't understand internet culture when you criticise the name. You should lighten up, just because something has a funny name doesn't mean it's a scam.

&#x200B;

>Safemoon and these other coins has 1 wallet with more than 50% of  the coins.

It's a complete lie that anyone owns a wallet with over 50% of the supply of Safemoon you can look it up yourself here:

[https://bscscan.com/token/0x8076c74c5e3f5852037f31ff0093eeb8c8add8d3#balances](https://bscscan.com/token/0x8076c74c5e3f5852037f31ff0093eeb8c8add8d3#balances)

The biggest holder is a burn address with 41% of the supply. Which can no longer be accessed by anyone. The next biggest holder has less than 4% and the next less than 3%.

&#x200B;

>it is just a ponzi scheme with  the entire idea being that people who come in last are gonna be bag  holders and everyone below will make a portion of the bagholders  investment if you bail out early before the rug pull.

You clearly don't understand what a Ponzi scheme is and haven't bothered to look it up. I have done the research for you:

Safemoon is not a Ponzi scheme by definition. The SEC gives one here:

[https://www.investor.gov/protect-your-investments/fraud/types-fraud/ponzi-scheme](https://www.investor.gov/protect-your-investments/fraud/types-fraud/ponzi-scheme)

&#x200B;

>A  Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that pays existing investors with  funds collected from new investors. Ponzi scheme organizers often  promise to invest your money and generate high returns with little or no  risk. But in many Ponzi schemes, the fraudsters do not invest the  money. Instead, they use it to pay those who invested earlier and may  keep some for themselves.

* Safemoon has never claimed to invest anybody’s money in anything.
* They never claimed they would get you a return with no risk.
* They refuse to talk about price and price potential. Just watch the AMA’s.

These are the main elements of a Ponzi according to the article and Safemoon has none of them:

**Guaranteed gains.**

* Safemoon has never guaranteed any gains and always said there are risks.

**Overly consistent returns.**

* Safemoon has gone up and down by different amounts. So is in no way consistent investment.

**Unregistered**

* Ponzi schemes are often unregistered. Safemoon is a registered legal entity in Utah in the US. All of the team are doxxed. You can find all of their social media profiles, LinkedIn, etc with a google search.

**Unlicensed sellers**

* Again Safemoon is a registered legal entity.

**Secretive, complex strategies.**

* The  Safemoon team are completely transparent. You can’t buy Safemoon anywhere without being reminded continuously about the fee structure. There is even a notice on pancake swap explaining fees that you cannot pass without accepting.

**Issues with paperwork**

* There are no issues that I have seen with paperwork they describe everything exactly how it is.

**Difficulty receiving payments**

* Safemoon can be cashed out easily at PancakeSwap and multiple exchanges, but I agree that processes in crypto can be difficult. This sometimes causes confusion, but this applies to crypto in general.

&#x200B;

>You will see a hoard of fake users/profiles just trying to  promote it. These coins have no utility

Now to address the claims of zero utility. The Safemoon team are the first to admit that they didn't expect this token to be as popular as it is. They've brought many new investors into crypto which will only benefit crypto in general.

The Safemoon team are developing a utility for Safemoon as we speak. They've started the development of their own exchange and NFT exchange. They're working on getting a debit card for Safemoon as well as other charity and educational purposes.

&#x200B;

>the entire idea being that people who come in last are gonna be bag  holders and everyone below will make a portion of the bagholders  investment if you bail out early before the rug pull.

There is no evidence this is a rug pull or that it even can be. Liquidity is locked and the team have never given me any reason to doubt their intentions.

As for early investors making money from new investors. This is how every cryptocurrency and stock works. New investors put their money in old investors cash out when they're happy with their return.

&#x200B;

Have you got any evidence that most users posting are fake profiles other than your feelings? You seem to make all these big claims that you can't back up with reason or evidence.

Safemoon is already listed on a number of exchanges and the team are trying their best to get bigger ones. The token is 2 months old bigger exchanges take time. Have you got any evidence that they're not building their own exchange or is it just feels again?

Finally, they're transparent because they've doxxed themselves, they have registered Safemoon as a legal entity in Utah in the US. They're also going through a Certik audit process which has asked them to provide proof of identity.

To conclude, Is it just not the case that you're relying on your feelings / jealousy / interest in other tokens to create this biased article without evidence? I literally haven't seen a single piece of evidence from you other than ""Ma Feels!"" or Trust me bro.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

OP has no evidence of their claims other than trust me bro and clearly lists several lies including that a wallet for Safemoon has more than 50% of tokens. Which is easy to disprove. The blockchain is public and you can see the holders. The biggest being the burn wallet which isn't accessible by anyone and holds 41%."

2021-06-02,"You couldn’t even invest $1,000 in Bitcoin when it was “first released.” You do understand there was ZERO pre-mine, and it was open source code uploaded on the internet for anyone to run for a year before… well… anyone really ran it. Satoshi mined a million coins and then left. Every 10 minutes a block minted 50 Bitcoin and credited it to the miner who mined the block. This was all done on a personal computer at this point, and there weren’t much in the way of exchanges. 

Bitcoin’s adoption occurred as a grassroots movement. Organically, over a decade. If you “invested when it came out” odds are you cashed out at multiple points before making it to “billionaire”."

Vitalik Buterin Introduction

“I was born in 1994 in Russia and moved to Canada in 2000, where I went to school. I happily played World of Warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock's Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit.

In 2011, searching for a new purpose in life, I discovered Bitcoin. At first, I was skeptical, and did not understand how it could possibly have value without physical backing. But slowly I became more and more interested. I started writing for a blog called Bitcoin Weekly initially at a meek wage of $1.5 per hour, and soon with Mihai Alisie cofounded Bitcoin Magazine.

In 2012, I entered the University of Waterloo; in 2013 I realized that crypto projects were taking up 30h/week of my time, so I dropped out. I went around the world, explored many crypto projects, and finally realized that they were all too concerned about specific applications and not being sufficiently general - hence the birth of Ethereum, which has been taking up my life ever since.”

So, blizzard did something right..."
2021-05-02,Surely the $25 I dropped on ETH this morning made this happen.
2021-05-02,Vitalik seems like one of these nice quiet kids that lent you his GameBoy once in elementary school and when you run into him 2 decades later he still seems like the same nice guy that now owns the fucking world.

2021-02-19,"I must say I couldn't agree more.

I'll give credit that at least ETH is working on scaling, but it doesn't help the short-term.

Right now, if you want to actually *use* coins, LTC, BCH, and NANO are probably the best 3.

Accepted at most major exchanges, fees that still make even the 25¢ minimum fee from credit cards obsolete, and tons of room for growth.

LTC and BCH have the added benefit that they're accepted at most physical locations that accept Bitcoin as well.

I don't care about the politics of a coin, I care about what's working for payments, and those 3 actually work."

I’m a small time investor. I put in a little bit here and there because that’s all I can afford, so when I see $20-30 being taken off the top right off the bat, it feels pointless to invest in certain projects.

PoW mining's impact is extremely, extremely high relative to the value it currently brings to the world.

The key here is that PoW mining is wasteful by design, and is unnecessary. The first rule of reducing waste is to *prevent* it by rethinking/redesigning. Reducing or improving supply chain impacts comes below that (e.g. using renewables; it's better, but not as good as removing the energy wastage in the first place). This is one aspect of why Proof of Stake, which redesigns decentralized network validation to be hundreds of times less wasteful, is so important.

Whatboutism doesn’t change that.

This is probably the most fundamentally misinformed conclusion on the USD that I've ever read.

It's almost the polar opposite. The only reason the USD works, unbacked as a fiat currency, is the fact that it's used as a global reserve currency for other currencies.

The value of the USD is solely based on this. All of the other currencies using it as backup is what give it it's value. If the USD ""destroyed every other currency"" then there would be nothing backing up the USD.

Further, if every country stopped using the USD as a reserve currency, then the value would similarly fall out the bottom.

2021-06-10,"Funny thing is she is right about Bitcoin (it is environmentally hazardous, as of it nowadays, of course) but she's John Snow about cryptocurrencies in general, as there are so many that would be much cleaner than all the other payment systems."

2021-06-10,Her identifying as American Indian was when her downwards trend began. 📈
2021-06-10,"This argument sucks. It’s like saying murder is ok because the US military wages war and kills people in other countries. It’s not a question whether or not American infrastructure is inefficient, because that’s not what the argument is. As another top comment pointed out, Bitcoins method of recording transactions IS unsustainable and is a huge barrier to entry for governments, companies, and investors who actually have to worry about environmental impact, as they are literally taxed for it."
2021-06-10,Your framing is so off. Bitcoin IS bad for the environment compared to other crypto alternatives. I imagine that a person living in El Salvador doesn’t care at all about what Warren said.

2021-06-29,"How is that possible? If you started investing in April, you had Max 12 weeks * 25 dollars which equals 300 dollar. Even if we keep the price of bitcoin stable for your investment how little did your boyfriend put into bitcoin in comparison to his other coins in order for you to surpass him? You were talking of thousands of dollars that he spent so he cannot have put more than 600 dollars into bitcoin as he cannot have lost more than 50% of value even if he bought at 65k. I mean cool for you, but it is weird nonetheless."

2021-06-29,"Does add up at all. Says he started investing on crypto around December in thousands and she barely started investing with DCA of 25 dollars and she has more coins than him. Totally a made up story. I started late January and I’m still up through this near market. No way would a Dec 2020 investor be down yet.

2021-06-29,"If he put 'thousands' in in December, his BTC would be worth roughly double today. You put $25 in April onwards (the absolute peak). Your $25 installaments are worth less than the fiat you put in. His 'several thousands worth' are worth double

How exactly is your BTC worth more than his? serious question"

2021-12-15,"And especially those looooong posts about what happened, which can be summarized in:

*""I shared my keywords.""*"
2021-12-15,"The worst part is most scams are successful because of greed. My fave is a somewhat recent news article of a woman who got ""hacked"" when she sent ethereum to a Twitter ""Elon Musk"" to receive double in return. Wtf lady."
2021-12-15,"To be fair, social engineering is considered a form of hacking."
2021-12-15,"Do you understand that nearly all of the most common tools in hacking have nothing to with what people imagine hacking is?

Hackers will laugh at you if you think hacking means breaking cryptography. Phoning your mum and smooth talking her into retrieving that slip of paper with the seed from your desk is a perfectly legitimate definition of hacking.

Actually breaking encryption is one of the least common forms of hacking. Most of it is just social engineering, phishing, stealing credentials and just patiently working on things until you find where people slipped up instead of breaking the things they did right."
2021-12-15,Most of the folks won't explain in details what happened because they will have to admit that it's their FAULT.
2021-12-15,Can't Malware steal your login information? Or Keyloggers? Etc.
2021-12-15,So you're saying that i wasn't hacked when i click a link from an email to integrate my wallet that contains 2 BTC and 3 ETH to a crypto pooling system? The sender said that i can make 20% gain once i join their pool?
2021-12-15,"I’m just gonna add for the all knowing OP… stealers, such as redline, have been targeting metamask browser plug-in. These logs are sold on various underground forums. Coupled with scripts, you could in fact, “be hacked.”"
2021-12-15,"Also whenever people sell it is a rugpull.

Crypto jeet 101"
2021-12-15,"I don't really get your point. It is well possible that one of your crypto-holding systems is compromised in which case your wallet/ private key is at risk without you interacting in phishing/ a scam.

Take the recent Log4j situation. You didn't have to do anything but any adversary could easily exfiltrate your wallet. Assuming you are using a secure passphrase to protect your wallet, this is not that bad per se. But assuming the malware will load a second stage which implants a keylogger, this gets very bad rather quickly. Bear in mind that patching the vulnerability won't stop already infested malware from functioning. Also, if you stored your passphrase in plain text you don't even need the keylogger. This type of attack is automated and relatively easy to pull off even large scale given a score 10 unauthenticated RCE.

You can extract useful precautions from these statements. Take them seriously. If an adversary is aware of a big crypto pile, targeted attacks are more likely as well.

I agree that it is far easier and more prevalent to suffer from self-inflicted breach but to say malware is a conspiracy is ironic."
2021-12-15,"OMG no shit.  Every time I read one of those posts it is the same shit.  Coinbase, Metamask, Trust, Binance, ""my shit got hacked"".  Then we find out it wasn't hacked, they did some dumb shit and gave the money to a scammer.  Or they got SIM swapped and ended up having none of their shit on app based 2FA AND they had a gazillion dollars on a goddamn exchange.  Every time."
2021-12-15,"To be fair, social engineering *is* hacking. And it's the most effective and common form of hacking at that. Kevin Mitnick's most useful tool was a telephone and a persuasive tone."

I know it was real because it was limited to the first 500 people so I had to act fast.

Who do I call to get my money back?  

The YouTube video is gone and I didn’t get the customer support number. 

A guy from ETHsupport in my DMs promises that if I send him 1 ETH, he will get back my other 5. Is this legit?"

quantum computing in 50-100 years would like a word"
2021-12-15,im also of the opinion that some of these posts are people realizing they owe a lot of taxes but now that crypto went down are panicking and creating a paper trail to “prove” their funds were stolen (the ol’ “I lost my ledger in a boating accident”). whether that would actually allow you not to pay said taxes or whatever I have no idea..

*”So let me ask the CEOs of the four banks-Citibank, Bank of America, Chase, and Wells Fargo-the four banks that collectively manage tens of millions of checking accounts for customers: while you automatically and at no cost got complete protection from overdraft fees at the Federal Reserve, could you please raise your hand if you gave the same automatic protection to your customers and automatically waived all their overdraft fees?”*

*no response*

*”Okay. I'm not seeing anyone raise a hand, and that's because none of you gave the same help to your customers that the bank regulators extended to you-help that the bank regulators recommended that you give.”*

2021-07-28,"TL;DR: Mike Novogratz is one of the most high-profile bitcoin and crypto investors.  
Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz has criticized Senator Elizabeth Warren's anti-crypto stance, saying decentralized finance, or DeFi, can be a progressive force that is more transparent for consumers than banks.  
Novogratz tweeted to Warren on Tuesday night: ""You really don't seem so progressive to me.""  
The famed crypto investor said: ""Banks charged $12 billion in overdraft fees, a fortune in ATM fees, a fortune in checking account fees. But you keep going after crypto where saving and money transfer is a fraction of banks.""  
""He added:""If banks had the transparency of DeFi protocols, we would not have had the mortgage crisis.  
DeFi is a catch-all term for financial products built using blockchain technology that do not require a central authority, such as interest-bearing accounts and exchanges that do not need banks, or clearing houses.  
Warren included DeFi on her list of ""Growing threats"" that crypto poses to consumers."

2021-07-12,"Space Tourism is meh. But the technology being created by these companies will allow for suborbital flights to take over from long-haul jet air travel - in 50 years it'll be the norm. It's not like it's pointless technology. The actual environmental impact of rockets is absolutely tiny.

Suborbital space travel as a replacement for trans-atlantic or trans-pacific flights is slightly less fuel efficient and slightly more polluting than a 747 jumbo jet per passenger (although it's possible that it could actually be slightly better depending on if they get a few more passengers in. 400 passengers on a Starship is a conservative estimate.)

However, my point aboout the impact of rockets being tiny still stands. The airline industry stil contribtes about **300,000x more** greenhouse gases than the rocket industry per year.

If we were to build a fleet of starships to take people halfway across the planet in 30 minutes to replace the airline industry, all we'd have to do is cut down car pollution by 15% to counteract it. Oh, and I didnt even mention that 15% figure is WITHOUT taking all the jumbo jets we're decomissioning into account as a result of this."

If you are tired of vaporware and stupid shit plastered everywhere in the crypto space, take 2 minutes right now and USE a crypto. You can motivate and reward the team for bringing something unique to the table without spending a dime. If you like what you see, then you can create a new standard by which you judge utility and value. You'll be a bit better with your next picks regardless."

* For home mortgages \\ loans \\ purchases - With a combination of NFT + Crypto + Smart Contracts, you could use your crypto as collateral for a mortgage loan, have the already created ""Real Estate Purchase"" oriented smart contract handle all the paperwork for the home purchase, deed transfers, title search, all handled by various smart contracts, etc... And then the NFT gets sent to you immediately. If you already had things such as the inspection done and approved, you could theoretically do all this and buy the house within MINUTES. Not months.
* Government budget and spending habits could actually be audited.
* A government backed crypto could replace Fiat and do so in a way that enables much tighter control over the monetary supply and in such a way that isn't such a ""Uhhh I guess there is probably maybe somewhere around 400 trillion USD out there circulating... maybe... kinda... possibly....""
* A voting system that would completely eliminate any and all ""This election was stolen!"" and ""This election wasn't stolen!"" debate once and for all. A blockchain based election system would be amazing as it would be immutable and there are easy ways to verify no votes were changed. It would completely shut down any argument people could have when it came to saying their votes were messed with. On top of that it would be auditable so that normal everyday people could run analytics on it while also keeping all their Personal Info safe.

2021-05-25,BREAKING EXCLUSIVE: Water Is Wet
2021-05-25,"Are people able to read this? I wasn’t able to. Also, this was published April 20, so keep that in mind. Personally, I thought this was brand new.  

Copying and pasting the article so we can actually read it:  


Even as China grows in economic and military power, perhaps nothing reveals Beijing’s weaknesses more than the U.S.’s control of the global financial system.

China has recently sought ways to counteract U.S. sanctions after the Trump administration targeted Chinese officials and companies over policies from the South China Sea to Xinjiang. Hong Kong’s leader can’t access a bank account and a top executive at Huawei Technologies Co. is detained in Canada. Even China’s state-run banks are complying with U.S. sanctions.

That’s one reason the Biden administration is starting to study whether China’s development of a digital currency will make it harder for the U.S. to enforce sanctions, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. The digital yuan, which could see a wider roll out at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, is also spurring the U.S. to consider creating a digital dollar.   

But instead of challenging U.S. dollar dominance and neutralizing sanctions, the digital yuan appears potentially more geopolitically significant as leverage over multinational companies and governments that want access to China’s 1.4 billion consumers. Since China has the ability to monitor transactions involving the digital currency, it may be easier to retaliate against anyone who rebuffs Beijing on sensitive issues like Taiwan, Xinjiang and Hong Kong.
“If you think that the United States has a lot of power through our Treasury sanctions authorities, you ain’t seen nothing yet,” Matt Pottinger, former U.S. deputy national security adviser in the Trump administration, said last week at a hearing of the government-backed U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. “That currency can be turned off like a light switch.”.  



So far China has mostly resisted hitting foreign firms in response to U.S. actions on companies like Huawei, holding off on releasing an “unreliable entity list” designed to punish anyone who damages national security. Any move to cut off access to the digital yuan would carry similarly high stakes, potentially prompting foreign investors to pack up and leave.
But Beijing has gone after companies like Hennes & Mauritz AB for statements on human-rights issues, even while government officials have been careful to avoid directly endorsing a boycott. In a Weibo post last month, the Communist Party Youth League declared: “Want to make money in China while spreading false rumors and boycotting Xinjiang cotton? Wishful thinking!”"

It burns fees because it was getting to be a nightmare trying to guess how much you needed to pay to get your transaction through, so they went with a new mechanism that makes it very easy to know how much you need to pay. Under the new mechanism, if the entire fee were given to the miner then  miners could trivially exploit the system, so something else had to be done with most of the fee. Burning is a simple solution that doesn't bring in governance difficulties.

As a side effect, according to Coinbase the fees are slightly lower than they would be otherwise. Coinbase still issues some transactions under the old system, and says the new system saves them about 5% on fees."

\- Creating synthetic shares to dump or pump the price is a giga red flag and will make Microsoft lose market share to its competitors which will ultimately REDUCE its price (compared to what it could have been) instead of increasing it.
  

  
\- If a Software Developer with the processor of the Atari would release today it would be labeled a shitcompany and forgotten faster than the average time it would take to write a code, which to be fair, takes a while.
  

  
\- Software will not make everybody ""financially free"". if everybody is rich, nobody is. you just want to ride on the back of the people that missed the software train that then have to work for you if software really flips fiat at some point.
  

  
\- Its not enough for software to be ""not as bad"" as the traditional banking buildings.

4: I don't think the idea is ""financially free"" instead of ""availability of financial tools"". I think many degens want to get rich quick, but the higher-level concept is financial tools and greater chance for stability and access rather than freedom.  


7: Crypto investors require zero knowledge of cryptography. You're being dramatic here. It's not necessary and should be irrelevant in the future. I don't know how computers work but I still use credit cards and Paypal. Crypto already is becoming and should be 100% user-friendly. There are still non-user-friendly problems that people need to be careful of, but cryptography? Not necessary. Nor is economic knowledge necessary. People should be able to invest in companies they believe in without being econ majors. Just like with stocks today."

Regarding #2, the base fee per block is burned to prevent miners (or validators in the future) from gaming the fee market in their favour.

It is a second order mechanic on the issuance of ETH in relation to demand towards minimum viable issuance which has long been the aim for security."

Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama got the first crypto amendment shot down by adding $50 billion in defense spending to it...
then when Ted Cruz added his amendment (which is what this post is talking aboit) to strike the clause from the bill Shelby petitioned to add his $50 billion defense budget to it. Cruz declined but since Cruzes amendment needed unanimous approval guess to voted nay to crush that amendment? Senator Dick Shelby himself.  
No amendment was passed and senate is voting on it tomorrow.
The good news in all this is the house doesn't like the bill as written so it'll likely get modified again then sent back to senate for another round."

“Everything predicted by the enemies of banks, in the beginning, is now coming to pass. We are to be ruined now by the deluge of bank paper. It is cruel that such revolutions in private fortunes should be at the mercy of avaricious adventurers, who, instead of employing their capital, if any they have, in manufactures, commerce, and other useful pursuits, make it an instrument to burden all the interchanges of property with their swindling profits, profits which are the price of no useful industry of theirs.” –Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Cooper, 1814.

If we go into recession, stocks will plummet, real estate will plummet like it hasn't in decades, the dollar is inflating like it hasn't in decades. Yes holding crypto in a recession will decrease your buying power, but I guess almost anything will during a recession. 

Holding USD would probably lose you less money if we really went into a year long recession now. But what if we didn't? Than you'd be losing a guaranteed 10% of your buying power pa, while crypto might bounce back to 3 trillion market cap in a matter of months.

We're in a bull run right now, and almost everything is trending upwards. People get over confident and start investing much more than they're willing to lose. If we keep going up and people are able to take out their investments and some more, then great. But sometimes that doesn't happen.

2021-04-17,for me if I ride the hype and get $1 per doge it's worth a few grand. if it crashes burns and sets fire to everything it touches I'm out $40. my point is don't put in what you can't burn. as with any investment be safe and be smart don't throw everything at something like it's going to retire you at the end of its run.

2021-04-17,"For all the people in this thread that are dismissing what OP is saying because you’ve made a lot of money on Doge, be wary of euphoria while holding an investment. Don’t get married to an asset, whether it’s a certain stock or crypto. Remember that your primary goal is to generate returns on your investment. If you *truly* believe that doge will be the primary crypto in 10 years or so, then best of luck to you. But even the creator of dogecoin said that it was made as joke. That’s why it’s not scalable, it was never meant to be. That’s why it has no cap on inflation, to basically take the piss out of bitcoin. Ignore the noise, it’s fine to be excited but don’t let the hype cloud your judgement."

We live in a tremendously unequal society that essentially equates wealth with morality. People see those with celebrity, power, fame and they want some of that. So when a celebrity they trust offers them an opportunity, many are inclined to take it. It's an attempted shortcut to success but for many people it's a perceived route to a place they may never have a realistic opportunity of getting to. 

It's so condescending to make posts talking about how your understanding of the crypto market is so absolute and your investment decisions are so rational that you can't even feel sorry for someone who falls victim to a scam, particularly when scams disproportionately impact people who are in a financially vulnerable position."

You wouldn't think that when people are saying ""30 percent of my portfolio is in crypto"" or ""I put x percent of my salary into crypto"", you'd think most people here have upwards of 10 or 20k invested by how they phrase things vaguely. So you're definitely in the majority of holders for crypto and never feel pressured to invest more just because people are ' yoloing their life savings into a stock/coin', because its the internet and i'm Obama for all any one cares here and 'life savings' could be 20 dollars of a broke uni student"

Mc should create a bigmac coin.

It will cement the bigmac index and would change the World we know.

For 1 bigmac coin you can get 1 bigmac in every mc around the world.

Mc could make billions of dollar from selling those coins.
It would be a stable coin but Mc could invest all the money they get as they want. Cause the actual token is not backed by dollars but by bigmacs which can be produced cheaply.
The coin would be the most stable inflationproof stablecoin on the market that can be redeemed worldwide.

So alot of it would just be kept by people and never redeemed. It would basically be free money for mc and for users it would be a game changer.

The way that the internet and the entire industry around it was able to grow was through letting it happen. Regulation is needed to some extent to increase adoption. Just look at the pump and dumps to see that at some point regulation *will* help adoption by giving less informed individuals confidence in investing/using crypto.

However, where we're at now, it's important to not smother the industry. It likely won't die if the regulation happens, but it sure as hell will go to other countries, which for the US would be not so great for its own self-interest.

Hell, for long-term tax purposes, stifling innovation is likely not great to do to a growing and new industry.

>Despite constituting a relatively small portion of business income today, cryptocurrency transactions are likely to rise in importance in the next decade, especially in the presence of a broad-based financial account reporting regime. Within the context of the new financial account reporting regime, cryptocurrencies and cryptoasset exchange accounts and payment service accounts that accept cryptocurrencies would be covered. Further, as with cash transactions, businesses that receive cryptoassets with a fair market value of more than $10,000 would also be reported on. Although cryptocurrency is a small share of current business transactions, such comprehensive reporting is necessary to minimize the incentives and opportunity to shift income out of the new information reporting regime.

2021-09-21,Only the percentages are asymmetrical. The market isn't.
2021-09-21,"“The market” is not asymmetrical.  Calculating gains and losses by percent is asymmetrical because percentages give you a relative value not absolute.  If you want absolute values just watch your dollar amounts (ignoring inflation, obviously).  A $20 loss is the same value as a $20 gain.

If your favorite currency drops $20 today and then gains $20 tomorrow you’re right back where you started."
2021-09-21,That’s why you buy the dip to bring down your cost average.
2021-09-21,I didn’t lose shit cuz I didn’t sell
2021-09-21,"People are going to downvote this because you don't understand math.

A 90% loss of sugar cubes would be ten minus 9 sugar cubes: AKA 1/10. It leaves you with one. A 900% increase in your sugar cubes is nine more sugar cubes. One times nine. You are talking about the same number of sugar cubes. Take nine away from one to get 90%. Add nine to one to get 900%. 

It's not exponential. Exponential is something completely different."
2021-09-21,"Correct... Here an example:

*An investment is worth $100. If it goes up 10 percent it will be worth $110. A drop of 10 percent puts the investment at $90. The 10 percent is based on the $100 start. After the 10 percent loss, the new starting point would be $90. Since it takes a $10 gain to get back to $100, 10 divided by 90 shows that, in this case, it would take an 11.1 percent gain to recover from the loss.*

The tip to remember when calculating return percentages is that the calculation always goes from the starting point to the ending point, with the starting value as the base."
2021-09-21,"I just look at, how much money did I have yesterday? Do I have that amount today? Cool. I don’t ? Buy till I do."
2021-09-21,"Using percentages overdramatizes the situation, if a coin loses $5 it only needs to gain $5 to get back to where it was.  I agree that it’s usually harder to get back up and may take a little longer but it’s not 100 times harder to make up a 90% loss"
2021-09-21,I don’t really get why this is? If crypto went down today… and tomorrow it’s back to where it was… then why was it not where it was yesterday? It’s the same number? Like… what?
2021-09-21,You just a paper hand
2021-09-21,I need some charts and graphs.
2021-09-21,Ok but after a $100 loss I only need a $100 gain to break even. Check mate.
2021-09-21,[removed]
2021-09-21,"it's not asymmetrical dude, it's just math and the way percentages are calculated. If your coin goes down $1 today it needs to go up $1 to recover... its symmetric."
2021-09-21,Thank you for the 4th grade math lesson.
2021-09-21,"Can I get the 900% gain without the 90% loss, please?"
2021-09-21,"This is why it is handy to use logarithmic returns.

When I go from 100 to 110, that's a log return of ln(110/100) = 9.53%. Obviously this is slightly different from 10% return like normal, but when you go back down from 110 to 100, that's a log return of ln(100/110)*100 = -9.53%. Symmetric.

When the returns are small (~1-10%) the log return is close to the regular return, so it's useful for comparison, but when the returns are large (~10-90%) the regular returns are less useful like OP is pointing out, while the log returns maintain symmetry."

The biggest problem is that no-one was blamed. All the big shots that benefited from that system until it imploded did not go down. We did not get justice. That was a huge frustration.

Also, I just want to point out that it is a good mix of broken financial system combined with deregulation that led to this bailout. Let's hope crypto can learn from that too."

First of all, the SEC did file a lot of lawsuits in the wake of the 2008 financial crysis. Establishing wrongdoing by several parties involved in the 2008 crash.Afaik some of them are still ongoing. Just implying the SEC lawsuit against Ripple was or is malicious and detrimental is very short sighted. In my opinion the SEC has a good case against XRP, especially against Brad and Chris (the founders, execs). They did a lot of shady shit in the past and the SEC might have actually followed their mission to protect investors.   
The goal of lawsuits like this is to establish what's right and wrong, create legal precedent and are often in the long run beneficial for the larger space (in this case crypto, before that, in 2008, banking), because they establish legal framework.    
For example, so far the lawsuit did establish that investors buys and sells aren't securities, just the ones done by the Founders of XRP. They are focusing on Brad and Chris as the malicious parties, saying the defrauded investors, which seems reasonable. That is good for investors and great that it got established. Especially if Brad and Chris are prevented from selling their XRP, that would remove a huge amount of XRP from circulation and drive the price up."

2021-02-24,"You can't invest in the future without it eventually becoming the present.

You can't expect to make significant money long term on an investment without the market makers getting involved. 

It's a 'having your cake and eating it too' situation. There is no world where a huge, global, currency remains untouched by wealthy people."
2021-02-24,"Bitcoin is just beginning to reflect society more and more, billionaires up top holding majority of the wealth. Only makes sense I guess, there's money to be made."
2021-02-24,"It’s a long time since BTC could be considered for peer to peer cash....... it is simply too expensive for smaller amounts.

It has grabbed the store of value position and of course that brings in people with serious money.

ETH transactions fees are taking it the same way and the crypto world is being flooded with “solutions” to try to get around that. ETH 2.0 needs to be fully online ASAP otherwise those other solutions will take hold.

There is no standard low end transfer of value token yet....... lots of options still.

There is still an opening for a low value transfer token with very low or no fees to fill the opening.

Whether it’s Nano or Doge ( Jesus.... ) or something else who knows but something needs to be adopted as a low value standard transfer because neither BTC or ETH are suitable."
2021-02-24,"We're not being held hostage per se. Billionaires stepped in with their big bucks, but they still had to buy on top of us. It's one of the rare instances where we held something of value they had no choice, but to pay us for it. And this is going to keep happening, because there are way more billionaires that you know of. They will all have to throw their bucks at this, whether they want it or not."
2021-02-24,"The real market manipulators are moving into the space, and if the retail investors think for half a second that the smart money cares in the slightest about them, they are in for a rude awakening.

2021-02-24,"Well, for crypto to be adopted, everyone has to get in on it, whether you're a billionaire or lower class. I'm sorry, but if billionaires don't get in, no wider adoption will be achieved, as disappointing as that sounds."
2021-02-24,"I don’t understand you clowns who think you have a right to decide who participates in bitcoin or how they participate. Bitcoin is open. Get your authoritarian horse shit out of here. Luckily, bitcoin doesn’t care what you or them think."
2021-02-24,"FIAT will be converted to BTC, the wealthy don't want to lose out on the biggest transfer of wealth in human history.   


Bitcoin is a store of value, if you invest in BTC, you invest in ""crypto"". If you invest in ETH, you invest in a utility token (Smart contracts).   
Big money is flowing in, and there's nothing to stop it from happening.   


Just be happy to have had the opportunity to buy in early. Even if it's an altcoin, you'll still be okay this coming boom.   
The safest option is BTC ETH ADA DOT, basically the top projects. However, there are other promising projects out there, which will make people extremely wealthy. My personal favorite is DIVI, because they work on mass adoption, by making crypto easy to store, trade, buy and sell."

2021-02-22,A dip is a dip. Your perspective on the implications are extraneous to a sudden drop in price.
2021-05-27,Thanks for the detailed account of how this played out. Very helpful in showing newer/less-experienced folks the many potential points of vulnerability to be aware of. Definitely glad to hear that you were using Authenticator vs sms 2FA on your crypto accounts!
2021-05-27,2FA for the win...on everything.
2021-05-27,Jesus that's a scary timeframe. Here's me thinking they actually had to physically swap your SIM like an idiot. Thanks for the heads up!
2021-05-27,"Sim swaps are really scary, they're apparently fairly easy to perform and they have the potential to cause serious damage.

I noticed that you posted on r/ledgerwalletleak too by the way, good job! Ledger's behaviour has been disgraceful.

I was a victim of the leak and I changed both email address and phone number after I was informed of it (of course the motherfuckers leaked my physical address too, and that's a little harder to change)."
2021-05-27,"Is this a US-based telephone provider that just allowed someone to call in and easily request a SIM swap? Would you mind sharing which company in order to help others avoid using them, or atleast be mindful how lax their id verification systems are?"
2021-05-27,"So I've been on the phone all day with the two mobile carriers.

Unfortunately my original mobile carrier is unable to restore my number and service because I don't have the PIN for the account. (The attacker changed it). I have no other way to prove my account ownership to them and I think it is inexcusable that they only secure accounts with a 4 digit PIN that can be changed without any history of previous PIN numbers. I will definitely be moving to a different carrier after this whole experience.

I have to go to the brick and mortar store tomorrow when they open to see if I can get it figured out.

This is been super frustrating but at least they didn't take my coins."
2021-05-27,"Anyone here use YubiKey for their 2FA?

 I'm currently using Google Auth but a hardware 2FA device seems like it'd be more secure and I just started looking into them. Would love to hear some feedback."
2021-05-27,"3 things.

1. A password manager. Use different random 15 character passwords for all your accounts. Use a very hard master password you can remember though.

2. Google Authenticator/other 2fa app for all you accounts.

3. Use whitelisted withdrawal addresses for all your crypto accounts.

These 3 steps should make anyone 99% less prone to these kind of attacks."
2021-05-27,"Yea... this is why I have coinbase set up to whitelist only, so it can only send crypto to registered addresses, and new addresses must wait 48 hours before being sent to. Inconvenient at times, but it renders me immune to this sort of thing, since I could just reset everything in that timeframe."
2021-05-27,"Almost always an inside job. Call your local police department and file a report. Every state and county has someone responsible for these thefts. The cell providers won’t change unless regulators step up their fines and enforcement. It’s not just a phone, it’s your life. They can afford to make changes but don’t."
2021-05-27,"I'm using Google authenticator but I'm a bit unclear on such and similar scenarios... For instance if my phone is lost how do I access the authenticator again? How would I access any accounts secured by the authenticator?

Edit: turns out I'm just a forgetful dumbass as opposed to an all-out dumbass and I did indeed write down the recovery codes. I just then promptly forgot about their existence"
2021-05-27,Crypto Casey in her 10 steps before you buy crypto video told me to call my provider and set up a password code for anyone requesting a new SIM card. It was surprisingly simple.
2021-05-27,Everyone is talking about 2FA but also don't keep a significant amount of your coins on an exchange unless you are planning to sell or trade.
2021-05-27,"If you think it can’t happen to you, you’re wrong

It absolutely can. Use this post as a sign to change your habits and be more secure. Go get a password manager and change all of your passwords and don’t use the same one over and over

Go get a hardware wallet and take your coins off the exchanges

Add 2FA for your accounts and not use text/call 2FA."
2021-05-27,This is exactly why everyone should set up 2FA! And make w backup too.
2021-05-27,"That SIM swapping stuff is some scary stuff. I had heard about it before, but never fully understood the process behind it.

It's good that 2FA saved you from major damage.

I also use 2FA wherever possible."
2021-05-27,"Here's another tip that I didn't see discussed when it comes to additional security: DO NOT USE THE SAME E-MAIL FOR EVERYTHING. Have multiple e-mail accounts that can be recovered with each other, use different passwords for each, and in the worst case scenario print/save offsite backup codes to each of these emails as well.

I personally have one e-mail for important stuff that I keep as secure and bloat free as possible, a general use e-mail, a formal e-mail for employment related stuff, and an e-mail for content that I post on the internet."
2021-05-27,This is a good advert for using literally every security feature available to you.  It's also a bad advert for these mobile phone companies and their inaction on this type of attack.  It has been around forever and none of them seem to be interested in fixing this security vunerability.
2021-05-27,"scary stuff

an important take away for others that aren't as savvy with securing themselves is that a lot of entry points for an attacker to start getting into your accounts is through your email since that's how you're mainly signing up for services

so as you said, it is important to get emails off of SMS and use 2fa with an authenticator"
2021-05-27,Geez that’s terrifying. 2FA is so necessary these days

And this whale doesn't look like they're going to cash out so they want to, essentially, forcibly seize his solana and make him cash out.

That sounds... Sub optimal."
2022-06-19,"Update on the situation:


A wallet with over [1M SOL just voted YES](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FVnuun6WUAI_AeU?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) on the proposal and allowed the protocol to have full control over user funds....


Solana is a meme and I feel sorry for the people that still think it is a blockchain lol


**EDIT**: Due to a lot of outraged Solana fanboys correcting me in the comments I do need to clarify that I have made a dire mistake. The tokens in question are not SOL but SOLEND.

While it doesn't change the fact that Solend is most probably owned by Sam and Alameda it is an important difference for some. It also doesn't change the fact that all the anonymous devs behind SOLEND are probably sitting at FTX HQ while submitting new lines of code to Github but yes, I do apologize for my mistake."

* Created a DAO 24 hours ago
* Created a proposal with a 1% quorum to steal $100m from a user who broke no rules and is ~30% above their liquidation level
* Set the proposal live for 6 hours while half the planet was asleep
* A single wallet holding 1.01% of vote appeared out of thin air, voted ""Yes"", then disappeared

2022-06-19,"Sounds to me like Solend doesn’t have liquidity to allow this to happen organically.  If it did happen on chain, they claim the expected actions of liquidators will likely crash Solana.  
Sounds to me like Solend is trying to save their ass by using the excuse that this could crash the Solana network.  You guys need to understand that Solana (blockchain) is not responsible for the actions of an independent protocol like Solend.  It’s Solend who wants to seize the funds not “Solana.”"
2022-06-19,"Honestly this sounded to crazy to not be FUD but it’s 100% true. The most fucked up thing is the liquidation price is $22.30 which is like a 30% drop and the proposal voting ends in less than 3 hours. I’ll be surprised if they even reach a quorum in that time so I kind of suspect they’re trying to scare this whale more than anything. 

Either way this is totally fucked up and would get me out of Solana immediately if I wasn’t already."
2022-06-19,"Not defending the obviously short sighted code that failed to prohibit monster whales or enabled orderly liquidation of outsized collateral, but what they are proposing to do is the same from a the user perspective as letting the smart contract liquidate the funds; this is what was going to happen automatically. 

The idea here is it can happen without clobbering the network and causing a crash and further losses to loan provisioners. The user is going to lose their funds anyway… but this definitely defeats decentralization and trustlessness.  It would be different perhaps if this was a regular dao function, but a contract upgrade to handle a one time edge case… ouch.

At any rate, the failure of the developers to consider the catastrophic failure modes speaks volumes about who should and shouldn’t be developing financial code in the first place.

Developers transitioning from industries like aerospace or industrial control where failure means a fiery death for hundreds of people or even a whole town poisoned are accustomed to considering the what ifs and identifying unexpected failure modes in software, providing fail-safe and fail- soft features, and in general usually not getting people killed. 

There are standards to follow and best practices to be used, as well as rigorous testing and attack fuzzing. 

It’s not that it’s not possible to produce safe code…it’s that we have a bunch of “coders” spitballing financial systems on weekend hackathons. Developing life safety and financial software requires a level of paranoia and mistrust of everything and everyone including yourself. Most developers just think their code will be executed as intended in the intended environment within reasonable, anticipated parameters.  

Life safety and financial developers have to make a screwdriver that, even when incorrectly made, cannot be used to jam between the turbine blades on a jet engine that hasn’t been invented yet, and then when it is used to do this even though it was thought to be impossible, it will fail in such a way to not cause damage to the engine or injury to the user. But it must still work perfectly as a screwdriver in all intended applications.

It’s a different ball game entirely.

It is very much buyer beware, there is no reasonable expectation of developer competence or professionalism and by and large the “auditing” companies don’t actually test for operational failures of the system, only best practices and obvious security problems.

2021-07-28,How is congress supposed to keep insider trading if the financial system is under attack by crypto?
2021-07-28,why the need for prediction ? it IS a major threat.
2021-07-28,"We can’t forget the fact that financial institutions could be a major threat to crypto as well. They have way deeper pockets than us, we’re talking billions and trillions of dollars. They could easily pull the financial fuckery that they do in the regular markets (and they likely already are doing it)."

2021-07-28,"It already has. Hence the FUD, crackdowns, regulations and such."
2021-07-28,unpopular opinion maybe but i hope crypto doesn't become a threat to the major financial system. Just imagine how regulated the sector will become. Already here in the UK we are having Exchanges suspending withdrawals and Banks not allowing us to send money to exchanges.

1. Hype
2. Volatility

Worth pointing out- Senator Sherrod Brown recognizes that blockchain does have other useful non-financial applications. Sherrod also claims that blockchain could be a great solution to the disadvantages of the current financial system."
2021-07-28,Yeah crypto is a threat but increasing the nations debt 40% per year isn’t
2021-07-28,"It's not a threat to the financial system per se but to the ones controlling it, eg. all the rich people. And with rich I mean very, very rich.

2021-10-25,A gain isn't a gain until it's realised. It's like taxing hypothetical money
2021-10-25,It will be like income taxes they will start with the wealthy and it will work its way down to everyone.  Then the ultra wealthy will find a loop hole and it will be a middle class tax just like income taxes.
2021-10-25,"If they tried to pass it, it'll get challenged in the courts. SCOTUS has already set the precedent with Eisner v. Macomber; a court case in which the SCOTUS rules that unrealized gains are not considered income and therefore any taxation would be considered unconstitutional."

Value is so fluid and nuanced, you can't really say it truly *exists* until the moment it's been used as a basis for exchange."
2021-10-25,"If she taxed unrealized capital gains above $20,000,000 I would have zero problem with that."

Was kinda curious how much he still has. Seems like he should still have a lot if he only cashed out $4.3M but then we don't know the exact dates he bought or sold on.

For reference, in 2016 Dogecoin was $0.0002 for most of the year, though it did hit $0.0005 on one day (which was regarded as a sign the world had gone insane). 

$25000/$0.0002*$0.36 = $45 million USD, though we know he can't have that since he already mentioned he sold some."

We laugh at noobs being burned? ""noobs"" are needed for mass adoption. With these scams running, crypto will never get there. This is a huge pile of shit."
2021-02-01,This leaves a sick feeling in my stomach. It was so obvious that it was a pump and dump but so many newbies got swept away by the hype. It's up to us as a community to educate the newer guys. These pump and dumps only benefit the whales that have held a long time and want to unload. It's bad for the overall crypto space

2021-02-01,"It was obvious, I was writing posts all over /biz/ and discord telling people. 

- Pump has already happened you may see one more pump before as they know most people will try get in 'early' but they're going to dump a few hours early. 3 hours before 8:30 they start dumping.

- There are not 200k+ people in those groups, it's 5000 people if that and a shittonne of bots, look at the numbers ""Active"" where is the discussion on Twitter, Reddit, 4chan? There isn't any, the guys organising it, XRP Bully and such are getting 100 likes on their tweets, the top reddit post on it has 2k upvotes, nobody is doing this.

- Tonnes of institutions and Jed control tens of billions in XRP, they control the entire market, you can't do shit against them. By announcing the time and coin of a PnD, you just let whales sit in front and open their mouth. Especially when Ripple are in serious legal shit to the point they got completely dropped from DAVOS and being the core payment system of their Great Reset project.

- Pre-pump at best will reach 0.80, There is insane resistance between 0.70 and especially at 0.75 it will crash most likely between 0.70 and 0.75

- If you're going to do this, use Cryptowat.ch and look at where resistances are ffs and if it looks dicey gtfo. Set loss orders and buy orders as well. Pick and target below 0.75 and be happy with that

Nobody listens. They see the pre-pump to bait people in and they go all in."
2021-02-01,"the DOGE community not only fell for it, but fully embraced it"
2021-02-01,"Got downvoted into eternity because I tried to say something. Worst part is, there are a plethora of people left in that sub who still believe the “pump” is coming.... it really is quite sad. 

The whole “target price of $150 per XRP” didn’t turn everyone away immediately. This helped me understand that no matter what, XRP holders just want to be reassured they can get rich holding their 2k XRP they bought at .30. I mean if BTC can be worth 40k, why not XRP? 😂"
2021-02-01,"These PnD’s are very hurtful for the crypto community. Not only do new investors get burned, it is also a big deterrent for a lot of people. We need these newcomers for mass adoption and this is not helpful at all."

2021-10-19,"On September 7, El Salvador became the first in the world to make Bitcoin its national currency. Bitcoin's value has increased exponentially in recent years. In Latin America, countries that have adopted cryptocurrencies also include VENEZUELA and CUBA. They are governments that have a tense relationship with the United States and that opt ​​for an alternative to the dollar to do international business.

  
Panama's move towards bitcoin adoption happened on the day El Salvador became the first country to accept bitcoins as legal tender. The country is adding its own unique stamp to the process by accepting other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.

  
In Brazil, distrust of institutions has led the use of cryptocurrencies to the point that today it is among the 20 countries with the highest adoption rate, according to the specialized firm Chainalysis. The expectation is that little by little, countries will begin to define their positions and rules around these digital assets."

I expect them to buy some crypto exchange next like Gemini or Kraken. There is also a huge update to PayPal App and its expected to be a single point for Crypto or Stocks or any other assets to be purchased/traded. 

Square already supports withdrawal and they will also make a bigger push. But Dorsey has not addeda any other cryptos except Bitcoin and so I am not sure he is interested in becoming a full crypto exchange trading all assets. [They will adopt lightning network for payments for sure](https://www.coindesk.com/square-bitcoin-jack-dorsey-lightning-cash-app). This was announced 2 years ago.

For the first couple months or however long it’s been since the video released, I was just cashing it out periodically. However, I decided I should just diversify it here and there and let it ride. My portfolio is a measly $177 as of today, but I’m looking forward to seeing where this goes!"
2021-05-11,"Since I dived into crypto in feb I am kicking myself for not doing it sooner. Besides excellent gains and blowing my mind daily on the whole crypto universe. I have rethought my priorities, I am sinking every spare penny into this. I cashed in my change jar, cut back on expenses, booze, food. I am thinking about selling some of the furniture (Ok, kidding about the furniture) but even if I broke even I am saving a ton of money. 

Oh and I have made excellent gains."
2021-05-11,"I agree that’s it’s easy to look at the price of BTC and feel like you’ve missed out. But I would suggest 3 things to help make a new investor feel better:
1.	We are likely at the same point in Ethereum’s growth that Bitcoin was at last cycle. It’s a different product that does different things, and it has potential to grow to 5-digit value in the next two years. 
2.	Even if you only invest in Bitcoin, you are likely to get results in the next 5 years that will put any financial product to shame. Unless you’re in real estate, VC for startups, or a small number of other areas that a general retail investor might explore, you are unlikely to find the potential for 2x growth anywhere. Even modest Bitcoin predictions would put it at 5-20x what you would get with most stocks or funds. And you have a very liquid asset that you can use as collateral, transfer quickly, etc.
3.	We are at a point in the curve where there are a lot of coins/tokens with the potential for exponential growth. These are, of course, riskier, but we are only just seeing the beginning of blockchain compute. It has a very high utility and also many act as a solid store of value. If you diversify properly (percentage of investment in crypto, percentages of that based on risk) you will have a tool in your portfolio that has the potential to give you rewards well beyond the typical retail products. 

It’s still 1998-2000 in internet terms. Google was still a niche player. Yahoo and AOL were among the biggest. Amazon was a bookstore. OS X was a buggy beta. Netflix mailed DVDs. MP3s were about as big as disruption had gotten. In the next decade, we are going to see plenty of projects die, but some are going to be the next Web 2.0, cloud compute, and Netflix. If you could go back to 2000 and buy tech stocks (and hold through the bubble) you would be very happy today, even allowing for the pets.com or Webvan investments you might have made. Zoom out and we are all very early."

I'm loving it and come what may I will stay involved with crypto, I love the tech, I love the pumps, I even love madness that goes on. If it drops hard it will be a kick but I will stick with it. One day we will look back and miss these pioneering days."
2021-05-11,Is it okay to just invest everything in something sold like ETH?
2021-05-11,"Sold quite a bit of my crypto gains a while back to get out of debt. Had I not done that, it would be worth quite a bit more now. BUT I have no regrets! The amount of freedom bought by taking gains and getting out of debt was 100% worth it. 

I recommend prioritizing getting out of debt (certainly high-interest debt, in any case) to anyone pondering selling gains but being worried of missing out on more gains. It could all go down any time, and if it does you will regret not getting out of debt while you could. 

Get out of debt; crypto is a lot more fun and low-stress after that."

Wish you all the best with your investment."
2021-03-08," HOLD UP.

OP - Given you've knowingly posted this into a cryptocurrency sub, I don't imagine you're looking for devil's advocate. But what you're doing is insane. And before I say anything else, please understand that I have a significant portion of my portfolio INVESTED in crypto.

First of all, as I alluded to, you DO NOT have $1000 in savings right now. You have $1000 INVESTED in crypto, which is objectively not anywhere close to being in savings. You've invested in what is factually the riskiest asset class to ever exist. This should not be considered a ""Wow, I've really turned it around"" moment. This is another bet that you're placing. You are irrefutably throwing away your accomplishment of saving $1000 and saying ""Fuck it. YOLO.""

Even investing $1000 into a well-diversified mutual fund would be a terrible move for you right now.

Step 1 is accumulating enough money to cover an emergency room visit, which you DO NOT TOUCH.

Step 2 is to stop living paycheck to paycheck by accumulating ACTUAL SAVINGS (a minimum of 2 months of expenses).

Step 3 is where you can start thinking about investing, at which point high-risk aggressive vehicles such as crypto are totally fine. I would suggest starting with 80% in stocks and 20% in crypto, but if you want to get crazy and go 50/50 that's fine too. I started out 80/20 and my crypto has grown organically to be the majority of my portfolio, but you should not start off funneling everything into crypto.

Step 4 is do not fucking day trade. Sounds like you're realizing that, but I just want to reinforce the good realization you've had and help drive that momentum forward in your thinking. Good job.

There are precisely two groups of people hyping up your post. The first (and largest) group is self-interested: crypto junkies that see money going into crypto and think your $1000 investment will pump their coins. The second group is the well-intentioned: people who think what you're doing is great because they don't know how bad it is. They mean well but you cannot let them steer your thinking either.

I mean it sincerely when I say congratulations on breaking into 4 figures. That has to be an amazing feeling. It took discipline and determination. However, if you ever want to break the cycle of living paycheck-to-paycheck, you need to seriously prioritize continuing systematic saving in your life. If you don't have the discipline/patience to follow steps 1 and 2 above before reaching step 3, then you can cheat and allocate 20% of your ""savings"" to investments as you go along. But you CANNOT put all $1000 now, and all $1400 stimmy, into crypto. If you do that, then whether you like to admit it or not, you are subconsciously giving up on yourself. Do not give up. Take control of your finances by following a disciplined schedule, and you will see the results faster than you think. PLEASE consider what I've laid out here."
2021-03-08,Congrats.  Saving money is hard and not touching your crypto is even harder. People leaving their crypto for 10 years have diamond balls.
2021-03-08,"1000 seems like alot, seeing that you were living paycheck to paycheck. 

Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.


If you're young, then I don't see a problem with an aggressive strategy. Make sure you have a stop loss or alerts setup in case of a dip."
2021-03-08,"Hey man, you need to get AT LEAST a 3 months safety net in an actual savings account. It sounds like you're using your crypto investments and ""savings"" interchangeably. 

Generally economic downturns/market crashes go hand in hand with lay offs. You don't want to lose your job and ""savings"" at the same time. 

So keep 3 to 6 months worth of bills in cash. Once you have that you can put everything you want into investments. 

I apologise in advance if I misunderstood your original post or made some false assumptions."
2021-03-08,"Congrats OP! Now that you’ve put a cool grand into crypto, make sure you are saving an emergency fund. Your 1000 is probably better off staying where it is, but god forbid something bad happens. I saw a really interesting take on this sub that emphasized the importance of an emergency fund as a way to stay invested in crypto. Who knows when moon? So better to find ways to HODL and use a fund specifically set aside for the unexpected."

Everyone starts somewhere, doesn't matter how much you are investing we are all friends in the Crypto Realm!"
2021-03-08,"This is going to get downvoted to hell but considering the government gave us all more than 1000 in the last year,  and it’s the first time you had a spare 1000 after living paycheck to paycheck,  you can’t afford to put your entire safety fund into something you can’t pay bills with.  You’re one broken car part away from using credit lines to negate any gains you might plan on seeing.  

Get yourself a safety fund and start putting a smaller percent of your weekly excess in a brokerage.   

Don’t spend money you can’t afford to lose."

2021-03-08,Hey I'm glad you joined the group but if thats the first time you have savings in 30 years I would reconsider not putting ur life savings on something that can -30% overnight. But that's just my opinion
2021-03-08,"If $1000 is all the money you have, you definitally should not be investing that in Bitcoin.

Open a savings account and save that money in cash for emergencies. Next time you get a flat tire or an unexpected bill."
2021-03-08,"Hey man, congrats.

Don't let anyone tell you that what you've invested is small. We all start off somewhere and we all start off with something.

As long as your money isn't in the bank, you're doing it right. Banks pay you jack all and invest your money to make themselves gains, not you."
2021-03-08,"Why do people on this sub jerk off posts like this? $1000 is not a lot to any adult in any western country. You guys treat this man like a child who just saved enough to get a new xbox. He gambled his spare cash at the all time high of an extremely volatile asset. Nothing more, nothing less. It might work out for him or it might not."
2021-03-08,"I will gladly take the downvotes to give you better financial advice- You should not consider money in crypto as ""savings"", especially if you do not already have your regular debts paid off and don't have a 3-6 month  liquid emergency savings fund to cover all your regular expenses if you suddenly had no income.

If you do have those things taken care of already then, yes, totally enjoy having some shiny new BTC! But every single reputable financial advisor in the entire world cautions that crypto is volatile and should -not- be looked at as an investment vehicle by the vast majority of people. They all advise people new to crypt to to -never- buy in with money they are not 100% ok with losing.

Since you already have the BTC bought and prolly don't want to lose out on fees for buying and withdrawing right away, one strategy you could use is to watch the market for an uptick and sell either in one sale or a few smaller ones to reclaim your capital. So if BTC goes up 10-20% in a bit, pull out that $100-$200 and put it into regular savings. Your future gains might be a bit slower but a big dip also won't leave you feeling like you made a mistake.

Again, if you are already financially secure with a solid amount of regular savings and no high credit card debt, congrats and ignore this! But soooooo many people got just destroyed last time BTC peak and dropped and I don't want the overenthusiasm of this slightly echo-chamber-ish sub to guide you to poor financial choices."
2021-03-08,"Well 3 decades of life bro? That isnt much. You will do extremely well im sure, starting it the right way!"
2021-03-08,"Bro... you only have that ""1000 savings"" because the gov gave it back to you. You need to learn how to save or you will be forever poor. Don't rely on the gov, they are only there to take money and deem if you are worthy of a handout. Take this money as a good first step, save up an emergency fund, and keep at it! No amount is to small to start saving. I'm glad you're not throwing your stim check/taxes at nikes or a new tv with your situation. You can be a millionaire working a normal job, with disciplined savings and time. Only problem is now inflation going to be so far up everyone's bum that even a million won't be enough to retire on. I strongly suggest the minority mindset youtube channel, or Dave Ramsey you can get a lot of great ideas. Be proud that you have decided to not want to be broke anymore, but remember to keep at it!<3"
2021-03-08,"Crypto aside, I'd say it's time to seriously rethink your job choices and figure out how to get into a higher paying career.  Or at the very least, get really good at budgeting and trimming the fat in your lifestyle so you can save more money.  Or better yet, do both of those things.  I mean, what happens if you lose your job and need to be survive for a few months?  I guess you either fall back on family(if you have any who would do that), or you hope you get unemployment before you get evicted.   Even if you manage to double your $1000, that's still not good money to get by on if things go south.   

You're now in your 30s and you can't count on crypto to better your situation.   Before you know it, you'll be 40, and then 50, and still barely scraping out a living."

2021-04-02,"> I want to thank the cryptocurrency community for keeping me strong when I felt like I was about to lose it all and for also reminding me that taking profits is okay.

Taking profits in fiat is certainly ok when you re-invest those in real assets, like a house that will increase in value.👏👏👏

However, to just cash out and sit on fiat I wouldn't recommend, since inflation is far higher than what's being reported by the Fed and media. 

**Here is a tweet from a guy who shortly after this tweet was blocked by the Federal Reserve Twitter account. 🙄 They don't want people to see the real inflation...**

2021-05-05,"I don't understand why people keep comparing energy usage of BTC to other things. Harm isn't mutually exclusive, it can be true that bitcoin's energy usage is bad even if it's relatively less than other industries.

Climate change is a real issue and a laissez-faire attitude towards it in **any** context will only cause more problems in the future."

2021-05-05,"Completely agree.
To be honest it won't make much difference to the average user, but trends will move towards the most energy efficient coins in the long run, just like vehicles nice towards hybrid/electric cars, just like real estate development works towards energy efficient, etc.

Climate change is a hot topic for most governments as well so these are not isolated views here and there. PoS coins will need to take more front and centre space if Crypto is to thrive."

2021-05-05,Fork Bitcoin into PoS and let's see how it completes on an open market place.  If you are right the industry will switch and if you are wrong you will create another useless shitcoin.
2021-05-05,"This is something that bugs me since the first day I've learned about PoW and honestly, I'm baffled how so many people decide to rather close their eyes and ignore this issue or worse, try to actively dismiss it. I really hope that the future will bring something that introduces the same level of security as PoW while not being so horribly inefficient.

Anyway, beautifully said, wouldn't have said it better. And that final tl;dr killed me :)))"
2021-05-05,Does all crypto mining have the same energy usages/constraints? Or is it just because btc is so valuable that’s the focus?
2021-05-05,[removed]
2021-05-05,Laugh in Nano 😂
2021-05-05,NANO!!!
2021-05-05,"This post and basically every comment has missed two crucial parts of this. The first is that BTC's POW consensus algorithm is enormously resilient and proven. No other crypto comes close to the degree of decentralisation and security that BTC offers. POS is not proven, like it or not. And many aren't even decentralised at all. The Ethereum network could be shut down instantly if Amazon web services were shut down. That's unacceptable. Part of this issue is that it requires an enormous amount of energy to secure and store wealth. If it doesn't, it isn't secure, period. You're comparing the energy expenditure of BTC to banks which is limited in scope. You need to look at what nations have to do to protect their FIAT. Imagine what the US spends to protect the US dollar and how much energy that takes? Yeah, wrap your head around that. 

The second part is the issue with energy usage. It's not the amount, it's how you generate it and that is improving all the time. It's much cheaper to use green energy all the time and BTC will be almost completely run on green energy in time. You can build a BTC mine anywhere and the best place is somewhere that has absurdly cheap green energy. It's happening already. 

TLDR: hardly anyone understands the issue with energy use by BTC and if they do, they realise it's just more FUD."
2021-05-05,[removed]
2021-05-05,"This is one reason why I’m a big proponent of green cryptos like Nano and VET (interesting stuff happening with their carbon credits dev). I’m aware that Algo is doing interesting stuff, but I really haven’t researched it well enough to comment."
2021-05-05,"BTC's security model is to SPEND as much money/energy EVERY 10 minutes as an attacker would willingly spend.  Why do people Honestly believe that THAT is a ""good"" security model.  Its like paying 300$ every day to prevent a thief from stealing your TV so you can keep the TV.  I cant think of a more inefficient way to ""secure"" ANYTHING.  PoW is the Electrical telegraph of the crypto world, Let it die already please."
2021-05-05,"Im alright if BTC died and better coins like Nano, DOT, ADA etc took over"
2021-05-05,"I'm sorry but this is ridiculous, Bitcoin mining is about 0.3% of CO2 emissions of Gold and only 10% it's market cap.

Here's what you're getting wrong you think PoW is a waste of energy, but it's not it's a process that stores fusion energy from the sun to be used as an asset, much like oil, gas and coal.

Much like Gold it's a store of value and much like Gold it's only valuable because no more then X of it can be mined yearly, and it takes tremendous energy from the real world to mine it.

Now here's where you're wrong you think it's an explosive cost that it's gone up exponentially but it hasn't, Bitcoin energy cost has peaked in 2016 and has even gone down in 2017, it doesn't scale with use and it doesn't scale well with price, you know why because mining is a business and bitcoin dificulty is self-regulating. You know what that means? It means that if you can't find a hydro source or geothermal with 5c/kwh you won't be in business for long, it means that if you don't have the latest hardware with the best efficiency you won't be in business for long and you know what the tarif changes up and down depending on what government bans it, hash rate goes down to zero in China, great it just became feasible to mine using graphics cards.

And that's the thing Bitcoin mining isn't simply playing dice, it's a tool that finds the most cheap and efficient electricity production on the planet that can't be consumed at the time or place of production, like poorly planned hydro power in the Himalayas or solar power with negative rates during summer days. That is what PoW is, a minimum standard of price of electricity, you want to build the biggest wind farm in the ocean but can't find customers even with the cheapest rates in the world, no problem make a business plan around Bitcoin's energy price. You want to build Solar Panels in space, Dyson sphere no problem the future is now it's called Bitcoin. And that's just looking at electricity but Bitcoin is also a search space for the most efficient transistor process in the world, even when nobody would buy laptops or computers anymore and it would all be smartphones and server rooms the miners would still be a big market looking for the next silicon, the next efficiency improvement.


Lastly you have a very dismissive attitude regarding the value of decentralized digital money when compared to banks. For better or worse classical banks don't store value, they split any paper you deposit into obligations and liabilities, it costs them money to hold and insure your money, they have to have custodians and audits and credit lines extended in all directions and lending and insurance on the liabilities and the lending. Bitcoin is none of that, the value is non-fungible, the client can also be the custodian, and it's all audited every 10 minutes. You simply undervalue the Bitcoin network by looking at transactions per second instead of settlement time, cause let me tell you something the olimpic gold medal prizes it takes about 3 months to settle millions of $ internationally. Yes Bitcoin, Litecoin and even Eth can't settle Mt/s but layer 2 implementations can, and those don't need people either, that can be automated and decentralized as well. And that's not even going into smart contracts, yes any field where foreign parties need to trust and audit each other from the clusterfuck that's futures and option trading to sport bets and insurance all of that can be automated in a trustful transparent way.

Now Bitcoin doesn't have to be everything to everyone, you can still use cash it's instant settlement and anonymous, you just have to believe it's still has value when you take it from under the mattress to spend it."

Without researching a single thing, I know for a fact that almost every note in circulation in UK and USA contains trace levels of cocaine and other substances.

Counterfeit coins and notes have been in circulation for as long as fiat currency, with traditional finance responsible for laundering it. 

Most coins are not minted with metals to the value of their corresponding denomination.

We saw on global TV pallets of cash worth billions of dollars being air dropped from USA to Middle Easten nations.

I'm not brain dead and  capable of remembering the likes of Pablo Escabar existing. USA alone has been riddles with mafia from Italy, Bulgaria, Vietnam, China etc for at least 50 years and they wern't using crypto.

Yakuza, Chinese Triads, Russian Firm/Family, Bonnie and Clyde, diamond heists, the fact many art galleries and museums cover up their thefts and reputation with forgeries.

And, y'know, pretty much every illegal activity that has ever occurred since currency was a thing.

Compared to that, crypto offers a couple of scammers and Silk Road on a public ledger. Oh, the horror. Won't somebody please think of the children?!?!?!

>You don't even need to say the paragraph, you can say some simplified short sentence like ""I support this amendment to this act"". An intern answering your call will add a tally to ""support this amendment to this act"" to the call report that is sent to the congressional leader and their staffers. It is an email containing numbers of how many people called about what. We can really work together to make this staggering.

>True, there may be some senators that are being disgustingly lobbied out of their decisions. But there are also those who are genuinely interested/confused on cryptocurrency and this shows them the general public consensus to support.

>You can literally call/email every week on repeat, it goes on a fresh new report each week. Please help in making this work."

2021-06-06,Lmao you clearly haven’t been to prison. I can say it’s better to delete ur wallet and forget about it until the next hype cycle reminds you to open it again. Prison is the worst place ever. All u will do is think and obsess about how ur crypto is doing lmao nothing but time to think in there day after day. That’s torture.

2021-06-06,"nLockTime called. It said to actually learn Bitcoin’s capabilities before you go YOLOing savings and committing crimes. 

There is a script to lock transactions from being spent for X amount of blocks. It has been used in Bitcoin for more years than I’ve been in the space. 

It blows my mind the millions of users we have here that don’t seem to have a vague grasp on the tech. 

This innovation isn’t purely monetary. Bitcoin is a technical innovation, and not learning it is like not learning how to Email in the 90s. Don’t hamstring your future in the space by focusing on green dildos and bloody mondays."

2021-08-31,I can beat you on that one. Bought $789 worth of IOTA in Dec 2017. Now it's worth a whopping $252
2021-08-31,What is your next investment?
2021-08-31,"I bought at a bad time during the 2017 bubble - but several different cryptos which sadly all had more or less the same outcome... :(

That being said, since then I've come across IOTA and it's honestly one of the only cryptos I feel comfortable holding even through bear markets, because it has actual innovation and amazing use cases, not just another copy/paste of existing blockchains with their inherent limitations. Plus it is 100% feeless, extremely green/low energy consumption, can do data and value transactions, etc. The new Chrysalis network is blazing fast with only a few second transaction times, works like a charm and doesn't have the issues of the past. It really has a lot of potential and I can't wait to see what the next 6-12 months will bring."
2021-08-31,How does financial independence feel like?
2021-08-31,"Still one of the projects that I believe to pop off immensely if they succeed with their vision. The potential is there, now it's just the execution.

And considering they cleaned up the foundation and structured it well it seems they're making nice progress on all points. Sure, we have to wait for coordicide for it to really show if it scales as envisioned but SC and lots of other things seem to come even before that which is sick.

2021-08-31,"You can look at this thread in one of two ways:

1. IOTA doesn't perform price-wise (poor investment in general)
2. IOTA is insanely undervalued right now (great investment opportunity)

Personally, I'm in camp #2. It's literally insane that useless shitcoins like Doge or SHIB are much higher in the market cap than one of the most innovative projects out there. IOTA is like an elephant in the room that somehow no one is noticing yet."
2021-08-31,"oh man, we're already going crazy thinking about this shit"
2021-08-31,"Now is the time to HODL dude. IOTA has been through some shit, but I believe their Tangle 2.0 is going to make fundamental changes to the blockchain space."

2022-01-21,"Personally. I’m not too worried. I can’t time the market, as soon as I sell it would bounce back knowing my luck. I’m better off just holding through the pain, buying on the way down where possible and waiting until in bounces back (which I believe will certainly happen at some point)."

2022-01-10,This isnt new since the beginning of bitcoin and this sub people say I want the price to drop so I can increase my stack cheaper. People are for some reason confident buying at all time highs but are then hesitant to buy at all time lows when they should be buying. We as humans are hardwired to be risk averse. When bitcoin is up it feels like it will never come down nd when bitcoin is down it feels like it will never come back
2022-01-10,"I have seen about a dozen of these posts on this sub in the past few days.

Yes, that is how human psychology works. Nothing, absolutely nothing is certain in the markets. Specially crypto. That bitcoin could fall back to 10,000 if a couple of whales decide to move their weight around. Yes, it is that fragile.

The constant violent swings in price, you think that is natural? No, that is all by design. Market manipulation exists. It happens and will continue to happen. We should learn to move with the market by setting benchmarks for taking profits and buying back in. 

Yes, when it hits 100k there will be people hoping for it to be 50 and when it is 50k, those same people will fear for it to fall further and not buy in. Only people who will make money are the ones who understand these cycles and have a set of principles they follow for their trades. 

If I was new to crypto and saw bitcoin fall from where it was to where it is in such a short amount of time, I will never have the confidence that it’ll break through its previous peak just as quick and would never put my money down. Now that I know a tiny bit of history of bitcoin and crypto itself, yes, I am buying in as it falls and will sell when it hits its previous peak and wait for another crash which is bound to happen because it always does. If/when it doesn’t, I would only lose the money that I never made and will be holding on to the money that I did make."

2022-01-10,"Some of you guys are just straight up gambling addicts. Your brain is fucking with you. You invested, I’m guessing, a good amount of money into crypto and then the recent downward momentum happened. Since you’re gambling addicts, you look at your unrealized losses and freak out, thinking you’ll be able to buy your way out of these losses and you’re basing all of it on pure speculation. So you keep buying these dips even though you’ve already made your investment in crypto before the market tanked. You justify it as DCAing and dip buying but essentially you’re just panic spending fiat.

2021-11-17,TLDR: ETH to 10k by EOY?
2021-11-17,">Not only is ETH a security

That's interesting, because Gary Gensler [directly contradicts you in this video](https://twitter.com/advaitavedantin/status/1460743621515177986?t=tcGqENbvQrQBhiMzIR5O6Q&s=19). Timestamp: 36minutes 

and the CFTC disagrees with you as well: https://twitter.com/CFTCquintenz/status/1426570174036168704?t=vfxdoMPQObNXsX7kgg0o9A&s=19

>it has always been manipulated by well connected and powerful people behind the scenes.

this is a conspiracy theory without any substance or sources.

>Joe Lubin, co-founder of ETH, also founded ConsenSys. He also bought 9.5% of ETH supply.

Pretty sure he didn't - source?

>At the same time, the SEC was prosecuting DOZENS of ICOs that were using the exact same approach ETH was.
Hinman’s, Clayton’s Director of Corporate Finance, speech where he says ETH is not a security was partly WRITTEN by some of ETH top investors.

Has the thought crossed your mind that Ethereum is a decentralized network and thus can't be prosecuted, whereas the prosecuted ICOs had a company behind them which makes it a security and centralized? 

>Other funny “coincidences” include: Claydon being hired by a crypto hedge fund 100% invested in BTC and ETH. SEC Enforcement Director Marc Berger being hired by Simpson Thatcher and Bartlett, part of the ETH Alliance and Hinman’s prior employer, less than a month after the Ripple lawsuit was filled.

Ahhhh. Now it all makes sense. You're a salty XRP bagholder. I'll clear this up for you: Ripple is a for-profit company that has been continuously selling XRP to investors even after the initial distribution had concluded - Ethereum has a non-profit foundation that sold ETH to investors only once in its entire lifetime. Even if you disagree that this is the reason for the prosecution - Ethereum never defrauded investors, but it sure looks like [Ripple did](https://ambcrypto.com/ripple-guilty-of-fraud-but-not-securities-law-violations-messaris-selkis/).

>Users and nodes have no real power to shape the protocol. This is virtually true of all protocols with a Foundation at it’s head, but we can’t forget ETH falls under this group.

Straight up nonsense. If you run a node you have the complete power over which changes make it into the network. Don't like the changes? Don't update to the new version. This is exactly how Bitcoin works, by the way. The only difference is that Ethereum is rapidly evolving - a smart contract chain has to evolve. I'd like to say that Bitcoin doesn't evolve - but it does, and Bitcoin's core devs write BIPs and code just like Ethereum core devs - see Taproot. Why don't you criticize Bitcoin devs for this as well? The ultimate check on power lies with nodes in both Ethereum and Bitcoin. If you don't like what the devs are coding, code changes yourself and try to win community support. That's how all changes work.

>The first piece of evidence here is the ETC hard fork. This fork happened because the wrong people lost money. The changed the code and the protocol for the first time to suit the wealthy whales and not the users or miners. They changed the rules to fit their goals.

The fork happened because a stupid large amount of ETH had fallen into the hands of a hacker. This defeats the entire purpose of Ethereum, especially with the move to PoS on the horizon. The fork happened because the community agreed it should happen - and ran nodes with the corresponding code. This was a one-time event that will never be repeated - in the meantime, plenty of hacks with much more at stake happened and Ethereum didn't fork over it. Entire EIPs were created back when the parity wallet's self-destruct function was called, stranding hundreds of thousands of ETH unaccessible. And we rejected it. Note also that average investors had hugely participated in the DAO - it wasn't just whales deciding over everyone's heads.

>The second piece comes in the form of changes to mining rewards. This was a blatant attempt to decrease supply by not paying the miners. More important than the way it impacts the economics of ETH, it points towards a centralisation of power. Rules can be changed on the fly with no consideration from the community but based on profits alone for the higher ups.

Already disproven. Nodes have the power, not anyone higher-up. It also wasn't an attempt at decreasing the supply. EIP-1559 was introduced to make gas prices more predictable and to cement ETH as the native gas asset on Ethereum (previously, miners could take off-chain payment for including transactions, but now every miner has to pay the base fee), and it has achieved those goals. Reducing the supply is a beneficial side effect.

>This leads us to the PoS change. This has nothing to do with energy concerns or with price of fees. This is meant to skip all the intermediate problems by getting rid of miners and let the token holders leverage their will directly. Don’t forget the LUDICROUS amount of ETH that was pre-mined.

PoS = PoW without extra steps. In both mechanisms, you put something at stake. In PoW it's computing power, in PoS it's money. Since you can just buy computing power with money, we can abstract the computing power away and use money directly - that's PoS. The amount of ETH that was premined went overwhelmingly into the hands of average investors. Only ~9% of the premined amount went to devs to bootstrap the network. Thanks to the 6 years of PoW inflation and redistribution of ETH, [ETH is currently as well distributed as Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb).  Needless to say, PoS achieves higher economic security as well.

>To quote one of my sources “Etherium is not a decentralized peer-to-peer system. It is a system with an unaccountable ruling class exploiting the working class, making promises they can’t keep, while spinning a wonderful narrative.”

One of your sources - a few dumb Bitcoin maxis on twitter that can't even correctly spell Ethereum? Phenomenal sources.

>Everyone was fooled into thinking EIP 1559 was going to be a good thing. How the Foundation pulled that off is honestly mind boggling.
This change made it so fees were more uniform. Uniformly high. And making sure that miners saw none of that profit by burning it.

This is wrong. EIP-1559 didn't increase gas fees. Gas fees increased because DeFi and the NFT mania coincided with the release of EIP-1559. Increased gas fees are solely a representation of increased blockspace demand. EIP-1559 actually slightly increased the gas limit, and saves people absurd amounts of money due to the predictable costs - no more guessing the gas fee. Without EIP-1559, the situation around gas fees would be much, much worse. And miners actually didn't see a stark decrease in profits because tips still go to them, and the network demand has been insane.

>ETH recent and future design is bad

This is especially ironic. You mention how burning fees is counterproductive for users, but you make no mention of zero-knowledge rollups that *already* enable gasless transactions for users - take dYdX or ImmutableX for example - they both have free transactions and free NFT minting thanks to the incredible technology that are zk rollups: https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48

>ETH’s had a shady start, has been controlled by a group of shadow players on the background, is becoming less and less secure and has no intention of not being.
At any point, any decision can be hard forked in. The miners don’t matter. Your nodes don’t matter.
ETH is INTENDED to shackle you the exact same way the current banking system does.
Don’t be fooled.

In conclusion: ETH had a fair start - anyone was able to permissionlessly participate in the presale which was announced months before it went live, whereas Satoshi was mining on his own, waiting 5 days before he sent a letter to his cryptography buddies to announce Bitcoin, and even then he continued mining so much that he owns around 1 million out of 21 million BTC. 

Ethereum is becoming more and more secure thanks to the economic security provided by PoS. No decision can be forked in unless nodes agree with the changes and update to the new version. ETH is intended to provide a neutral ground for anyone to perform any action possible on a Turing-complete smart contract platform with a roadmap that is partly live, enabling instant and gas-less transactions on zero-knowledge rollups that inherit Ethereum's security.

Don't be fooled by salty Ripplers or Bitcoin maxis that see the writing on the wall - Ethereum is an unstoppable force that can't be stopped by anyone, especially not some basement dwelling Bitcoin maxis.

One more point: Notice how much time it takes to disprove bullshit? It's so easy to write a FUD post like this but takes a lot of explaining to debunk. Bitcoin maxis use this tactic and cry ""BUT THE PREMINE!!!"" without ever explaining what the rules were and how it happened. Don't fall for this bullshit."
2021-11-17,Well.. half of the market is created by ether
2021-11-17,">This change made it so fees were more uniform. Uniformly high. And making sure that miners saw none of that profit by burning it.
Burning the fees essentially made sure that the biggest holders get they profits increased because every ETH is worth more, while miners that actually keep the network safe get a pay cut because there are less fees per block for them.

Gotta be honest here, and this is only from my own personal perspective. 

The fees arent higher because of eip1559, the fees are higher because of the demand for blockchain space (aka usage).

Also, the mining rewards didn't really go down all that much post 1559. If anything they've gone down from so much more hashpower entering the network.

Both of these things are verifiable."

2021-05-01,"The [ETH/BTC](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHBTC/) ratio has skyrocketed from **.024** in the beginning of January 2021 to **.051** today.

In the 2017 bull run, the ratio got as high as **.119**.

If the ETH/BTC ratio were to reach those same levels in this bull run, the price of ETH would be **\~$6,860**.

*(BTC current price $57,665 \* .119 = $6,862)*

Some additional considerations:

* The above calculation assumes the price of BTC were to remain the same.
* If the price of BTC were $100,000 and the ETH/BTC ratio were .119, the price of ETH would be $11,900

Market"
2021-05-28,"Dear student,

You're a sheep in the wolves' den. You're stepping in their game, in their market. The goal is to make you lose your money. All of it. Through fomo and fud. Up and down. And you'll always buy or sell too late. Oh you want a 50x leverage ? Let the market pull a beautiful opposite candle JUST to liquidate your position.

Retail traders VS market makers.
Sunday traders VS corporate traders.
Noobs VS pros.

Understanding support and resistance is useless. Drawing lines and triangles is useless. The market moves where it wants. You have zero influence on it.

They are on the phone pressing the buttons simultaneously. Meanwhile, wage cage traders are literally playing slot machine, thinking they can catch a trend. There is no trend. The ""trend"" is an arbitrary word we use when we realize too late that the market is moving prices. We are trying to interpret something that makes no sense.

There is just TOO much news out there. Emotions are running way too high. Youtubers and other frauds are actively participating in the shitshow, with their blood red thumbnails, their capital titles. I mean they fucking tell people to buy or sell. What the fuck. Fuck them.

When it comes to money, big money, you simply are not ready.

It must be fun to be a market maker.

Edit : expect some more drops. Harder ones. Not all the rich got aboard yet. They need to bring prices even lower so they can let their little friends in. So they can take your money."

2021-09-12,"She's most likely to copout to ""I promote things all the time on my page, they pay me to post pictures. I didn't know it was a scam, oh my poor followers 😢""

That would probably be what she wants. More spotlight on her. Her and her family are literally real life demons, sucking everyone's energy and attention."
2021-09-12,In reporting this to the SEC isn't that this community acknowledging that crypto is a security?

2021-09-12,[removed]
2021-09-12,"Why on earth are you encouraging the SEC to get involved with crypto?

Advocating for a regulatory body to get involved with cryptocurrency is entirely antithetical to the primary objective cryptocurrency serves to achieve. No regulation - no intermediaries and immunity from outside forces.

The SEC are rats who love when people like you claim you’ve been hurt by it’s unregulated nature. All giving them ammunition to push further crackdowns. 

Kim’s a piece of shit, there many pieces of shit - don’t impulsively invite prying eyes into your life thinking they want to help you.

It’s all about control."

2021-09-12,What happened to not wanting centralization? Are people really wanting crypto to become more regulated?
2021-04-05,"This paragraph does a nice job driving the point: 

""I could earn $25 cash back or I could earn $25 of bitcoin, which 10 years from now could actually pay for that original purchase I made,"" said Thomas Harrison, who is developing a credit card with Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange, that is set to launch this year."
2021-04-05,I'm down! Would be awesome if you could choose your crypto too.
2021-04-05,Wow. That is a smart adaptation for BTC and a smart way to get BTC. If this is implemented it would be huge for crypto.
2021-04-05,"This is a no brainer. Who wants cash back when you can get an asset back in return, especially one that has been growing in value over its existence.

I know cash back might be more convenient but if we could earn something of value instead, I would use a credit card more often."
2021-04-05,I think it's a brilliant idea truth be told.
2021-04-05,"Surprised the article didn’t mention Crypto.Com. They currently have 10mil users and a prepaid visa debit card I’m getting 5% cash back on all purchases. None of those weird cash back lottery thing.

Anyway, had to shill for a moment cuz the whole article is about the companies trying to setup a Visa card while CDC has been doing it for awhile.

Edit: might as well add that crypto.com were the ones that helped visa execute an onchain stable coin transaction... excited what this will hold in the future: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-visa-exclusive-idUSKBN2BL0X9"
2021-04-05,"If the rewards rate they give you is competitive, this would be a game-changer for me. I like to play the CC game, but if I can get 1-2% back in the form of BTC, I'd stop and just use that."
2021-04-05,What are the fees like.
2021-04-05,Can you withdraw to your cold wallet?
2021-04-05,"Kinda funny, bitcoin originally sought to dismantle the need for third parties in a financial transaction, but now adding bitcoin as a reward on a credit card, you have everyone lining up for more debt and transactions through visa.

It's like, cutting the cord on your TV to stick it to Comcast only to be roped back in by using their internet services."
2021-04-05,"The problem with this advertorial is that it doesn't once mention the annual fees associated with these btc cards.

My citibank double cash card pays 2%, all day everyday, for purchases (1% on charge, 1% when I pay the balance every month). That 2% can be shoveled into btc if you so choose with no annual fee. I no longer keep airline cards beyond their promo periods.

In comparison, These btc cards all seem to have $100-$250 annual fees. Fuck that."
2021-04-05,Blockfi been on this forever but they haven’t rolled out the card at all. What’s up with that?
2021-04-05,"I use the Crypto(dot)com Visa for literally everything. I’m staking $500, and the 2% cash back is fantastic."
2021-04-05,Anyone that uses these have a recommendation on what to get?
2021-04-05,"The points about why this may not be the best use of credit card points seems valid, but this is still great for crypto. Tons of new people will still do this because it is cool, thus increasing demand on a limited supply = prices go up.  As pointed out, due to high conversion fees this may effectively lock up a fair amount of Bitcoin from being floated."
2021-04-05,"in a way you're still getting miles both ways.  the bitcoin way is 238,855 miles."
2021-04-05,"I'd actually use a credit card this way, I've never been in an airplane in my life and I'm probably not going to do so ever."
2021-04-05,"Nothing juicer than Bitcoin as a reward for credit card purchases.

Impatiently waiting for my BlockFi credit card, I'm just in 185,965th place, shouldn't be too long 🥲"
2021-04-05,"Damn, I would also really rather BTC over airline miles"
2021-04-05,Yes 100%. Miles don’t build that much value over time.

2021-08-08,"They can do what they want. They can't shut down the crypto industry any more than they can shut down the internet. Or the international drug trade for that matter. Crypto exists, and it may have to move around a bit, or even become a little more shady and black market, but, just like methamphetamine, it has been discovered, and regardless of what government has to say it will continue to exist regardless.

And, perhaps, if they do manage to crash it a bit, maybe enough people will have their finances ruined enough to finally riot for real and bring this whole civilized mess to the ground, but that is probably just wishful thinking on my part and a subject for a different sub."

2021-05-23,"I’m probably going to get downvoted to oblivion but I’ll give it a shot. I built a mining rig in 2016 and made out alright, but then Bitcoin did a huge pullback similar to the one we have going right now (but I held through til ~32k.) I think we have more room to fall. With the crypto market not being as regulated as the stock market pullbacks like this one can be primarily because of price manipulation by hedge funds and other big players with no real repercussions for them. Elon, FOMO, big banks, hedge funds drove it up. Same actors are driving it back down. Am I long term bullish on Bitcoin? Absolutely, I think we’ll see it hit a million. But pullbacks like this are going to happen after the parabolic upwards momentum we’ve had. And it also doesn’t help that a looming recession in the US and other countries are possible. Not financial advice, I’m smooth brained. Take all this with a grain of salt."
2021-05-23,"lol

""The Bitcoin Halving"" means the schedule in which every four years the rewards for mining are cut by 50%. Meaning the BTC in circulation generally becomes more valuable as mining becomes less efficient.

2022-01-16,"Clarifying, because there is a bunch of misinformation in this thread. “956 ETH” is the volume on the secondary platform, where users sell to other users. This person made money from selling the initial 1100, but they were priced at $0 I believe, which means they made $0 from a primary sale.

There is a royalty for the owner of the collection, so this person has made 956 ETH * .05 (5% royalties just an example, I do not know exact royalty), which is ~50 ETH.

It’s still wild and weird, but click bait headlines are stupid"
2022-01-16,I mean If someone can sell her fart in a jar as nft  everything is possible. What a world we are living in .
2022-01-16,Onlyfans without having to give a cut of the proceeds
2022-01-16,"> desperate bidders

Maybe they expect hot and revealing governance proposals."
2022-01-16,I see literally zero difference between this and the other silly shit people are selling as NFTs
2022-01-16,And OP sharing it is giving her publicity. All of this has got to be planned
2022-01-16,Yeah sex sells.
2022-01-16,"Sooner or later everything turns pornographic, even crypto"
2022-01-16,"If any of you have any illusions that porn won't be one of the top things driving crypto, you're going to miss out on some opportunities."
2022-01-16,"Fuck it, dick pic NFTs coming at y'all tonight. 0.1 ETH per inch."
2022-01-16,"Lol

This was always coming. Bet she also makes a killing from only fans"
2022-01-16,"I wonder why it's not mentioned here yet, but this lady is the sister of Binance's founder Changpeng Zhao, she has insane connections."
2022-01-16,We live in a simp society
2022-01-16,"That issue, when, although you think this is ridiculous, you know it is still slightly better than farts in a jar NFTs.


What a time."
2022-01-16,"honestly, I applaude the business acumen. clearly, there is demand for this."
2022-01-16,A friendly reminder: jerking off is free.
2022-01-16,Times have changed ; Dam in my day  .you could  get a nice lap dance  before you hear about how she is using the money to pay for college.
2022-01-16,"2022 gonna be the year of this now. Just wait for it. Kim K gonna do it, and loads of Insta people. I don't even know who this chick is, and yet her NFT market has exploded. I don't even really like the style of them either. They seem pretty tacky. And with selfies, she can make a million more. So these might be worth a lot now, but if she makes 10,000 more different ones they'll probably end up a few dollars each. But her business model to cash in on NFT hype is a winner. Just imagine when some big names get involved though."
2021-06-23,"Buy when suicide hotline is listed, sell when you see a bunch of rocket and diamond hand emojis.  That's my only financial advice. 😂"
2021-06-23,"How can people be sure of anything, I’m still not sure if we’re in a market"
2021-06-23,"Tbh this fiasco since May helped me to disconnect from my portfolio. I remember I kept checking it every 30 minutes. Now I check it once or twice a day.  I'm in this for the long run, and I definitely feel healthier mentally not checking prices all the time."
2021-06-23,Wake up tomorrow. Look at the sky. Make banana pancakes. Share them with someone you love. This IS financial advice.
2021-06-23,"We're up like 4% from yesterday and still low AF, I dont see how we're out of the woods just yet"
2021-06-23,But... This IS advice. Do I take your advice or do I ignore it for being advice
2021-06-23,I usually come for the emotional shitshow. People lose their shit every time we tank and it is very entertaining to watch.
2021-06-23,"Instructions unclear, leveraging 125x on BTC"
2021-06-23,"I believe that its just that market conditions bring out both sides of the fence. I am a bull, have been a bull even when we hit 28.3k, I just wasnt here mentioning it. On red days, bears come up, on green days, bulls come up. Its not that the sentiment changes, its just that either group gets louder based on the price action. And yeah, there are also some people who contatnly flip flop, but I dont think they are that much."
2021-06-23,"Pretty sure that most people come to the sub for emotional support, validation of their previously held opinions and shitposting....

....oh, and moons. Tasty, tasty moons."
2021-06-23,I fraternise on this sub for the sense of community not for the advice. It's rare to have a real world opportunity to discuss crypto and investing in general without it being frowned upon. It's nice just conversing with like minded apes.
2021-06-23,Sediment changes far too easily here
2021-06-23,"My wife’s sentiment seems to be the best indicator. When crypto was ripping she began every morning watching crypto “experts” on YouTube. Ended the day the same way. Checked prices on her phone every 15 minutes. She’s watching a lot less now but today she did say “to the moon” about some coin, probably DOGE, which tells me the bear will be roaming longer."
2021-06-23,Can somebody suggest me a place I can genuinely go to for advice?
2021-06-23,"The entirety of the world financial markets are under stress and as unstable as ever before and people are wondering why crypto, the most volatile of markets, is being extra volatile lately?

It's true though that nobody knows what's gonna happen and whoever thinks they do is fooling themselves. We are being taken for a ride and it's best to just buckle up and ride it out until the storm is done."
2021-06-23,Nobody knows anything. It’s all speculation
2021-06-23,"I'm just here for the vibes. I like being in the mix of everything going on. 

Don't let everyone here mess with your head."
2021-06-23,"I dont know anything ... but i will tell you what i think is happening with crypto world in this last 4 months i am in...  i believe billionaires are playing with us. At first i thought crypto is freedom, but i feel like we are being played hard. Somehow they managed to make crypto world their playground."
2021-06-15,"This is awesome, congrats on the gains!"
2021-06-15,Forced diamond hands 💎🙌🚀.
2021-06-15,Almost as good as going to jail
2021-06-15,"Please someone come up with a hardware wallet that locks for an extended period of time! 

I want a poor man’s trust."
2021-06-15,"If I never moved the original Bitcoin I bought on coin base all those years ago I would have x60 gains instead of only x 20 from a hundred dollars lol I know a ton of people made huge bank from alt coins but I could’ve gotten a size-able free check from doing nothing, all that research and investing did me dirty cause at end of 2017 I decided to never take out & hold no matter what, lost 95% of my portfolio and the coin I was invested in eventually got deleted as founder cashed out his $500k share and abandoned project without telling anyone"
2021-06-15,"Congrats! Nothing seems to beat the involuntary HODL, like people who were locked out of their wallet only to find it's retrievable years later."
2021-06-15,"I'm 15 and I invested $50 in vet and xrp using Binance 3 months ago,I knew I would be forced to hold and I intentionally did it because I knew it was the way to go. Can't wait to turn 18 and see my gains."
2021-06-15,"Now that they listed SHIB, I wouldn’t be as optimistic for the new 16 year old entrants’ 2 year forced hold ;)"
2021-06-15,"For those thinking this guy's a whale from that initial $20 investment, 1000% gain is just x11. So he has $220 now."
2021-06-15,"How do you guys invest in crypto at the age of 16? I wasn't give a single f\*ck about money at that age and all I think about was playing video games all the damn time. As you guess, I regret so much. Not gonna lie, I envy you. You deserved it, even if you are forced to be a diamond handed lmao."
2021-06-15,"Hey that's great! Not sure if you stake any of your crypto, but you should do that too if possible."
2021-06-15,"Dude, you've been taught the most important lesson in investing at the absolute perfect age.

Enjoy setting yourself up for an awesome future. DCA, BTD, HODL, PROFIT."
2021-06-15,That would kinda be a cool program. Invest a small amount of money when you're in your early teens and have your account locked until you're 18.
2021-06-15,"No worries, even if you were to contact Coinbase when you were 16 it would probably still take about 2 years for their remarkable support to reply back."
2021-06-15,"Be underage, go to jail, lose memory, lose keys/passwords. What else am I missing for best holding methods?"
2021-06-15,"Just like what Paulo Coelho wrote: When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it."""
2021-06-15,I read yesterday the people with best returns are the holders who either died or lost account info to log in . Buy to hold is how it’s done
2021-06-15,So you have $200?
2021-06-15,So your the Bitcoin whale 🐳

2021-11-13,"What you're not realizing is that people don't give a shit.  Look at the GM, GN, WGMI, FREN shitcoins that just mooned.  It's the same thing.  Just like shitcoins, nobody cares about the actual product, just the value of it.

In NFTs we will eventually see a shift, but right now they are the equivalent of shitcoins."
2021-11-13,I made an NFT of your post. Will not sell for less than ETH ATH.

If you want to launder money, these ugly ass NFTs are a great tool!"
2021-11-13,Same - Im a professional artist and lots of the digital nfts took literally 30 minutes to make.
2021-11-13,Popular opinion: your opinion is not unpopular.
2021-11-13,"99% of NFT projects are unoriginal bandwagon doodoo imo. There’s a real hate for NFT’s by most people outside of the crypto circle right now. Seems to be getting worse too. I don’t blame them. NFT space is still maturing, and it’s hard to convince people how important NFT’s will be to our future when all the media does is talk about how a picture of a rock sold for over $1 mil and how “terrible” they are for the environment. We need real world applications for NFT’s"
2021-11-13,"thats like, the most popular opinion ever"
2021-11-13,True but NFT’s aren’t fully about how they look
2021-11-13,You have just offended my one of a kind jpeg rock sir...
2021-11-13,[removed]
2021-11-13,"These guys making bucks from NFTs talk about is ""community""... Like how the hell does a bunch of pixelated apes do anything. What am I missing"
2021-11-13,"I think of it like early days of the WWW. Websites looked like absolute trash with highly pixelated gifs all over them. It feels like a throwback to ""new beginnings.""   


That being said, I'm not personally interested in NFT art. But the concept of owning digital things is appealing in general. I don't care about meatspace art ownership, so that translates into digital art ownership too. But I do care about the general concept of owning things in meatspace rather than renting them, so I'm hopeful that NFTs will allow for more of that (outside of ""art') in the future."
2021-11-13,Not unpopular
2021-11-13,I just wish I was the guy that sold an NFT of a rock for 1 million!

While inferior retail investors like us get the news hours later.

2021-06-09,This might be a stupid question but why does the price keep going down even though so many coins are being bought? I’ve seen like 2 other posts that whales were buying recently
2021-06-09,I wonder how many whales there are that we have no idea about because they hold in several wallets. Seems like the smarter way to go to me.
2021-06-09,"C'mon you guys really believe this fake shit?
Whales can't buy Bitcoin,
Yes some phones are waterproof but I don't think a whale is dexterous enough to use a smartphone or laptop underwater with a 10ft dorsal fin...

2021-09-08,It's ridiculous what's happening. Coinbase has been playing by the rules more than anybody. I think they are actually afraid to give Coinbase full regulatory approval. It would mean a regulated entity could offer real market interest rates in USD while banks can only offer negative interest. It could potentially cause an economic crash because the rational decision for everybody would be to extract all your money in your bank account and put it into a coinbase savings account. But as we all know this is not something the fractional reserve system can handle.
2021-09-08,Fuck the SEC!
2021-09-08,"FUCK the SEC, they claim to be looking out for the small guys. How about getting rid of the day trade limit then? How does it make sense to bar people with less money to get out of a bad position?! I'm so tired of this BS."

""Without these conflicts, it's hard for regulators to give clear instructions. In the long term, all these problems will be solved once the SEC gives a clearer definition of what is allowed, Wo added.”

**Wrong!** It’s not the SEC’s (executive) place to determine what is or is not allowed. That is the place of Congress and State legislations. Courts (judicial) aren’t meant to create policies, only to determine the Constitutionality of policies.

…which is what Cuban was getting at."

2021-09-08,"The lack of forsight from these people when the SEC went after Ripple, is staggering. Anyone who knows anything about that case knew the SEC overstepped and that the outcome of that case will set an important precedent for the market. Ripple is one of the companies that's done the most to comply with US regulations and tried their hardest to appease regulators. And even that wasn't enough.

The entire crypto space needs to band together against US government agency overreach and demand clarity. For all our sakes. Divided we fall."

2021-05-07,"Here are a few options to stake/ earn:

ADA: get a Yoroi, Daedalus or Exodus wallet (there are others), pick a stake pool and wait 16-20 days for your first earnings, rates are around 5%

KuCoin offers soft staking (where you don’t need to lock for a certain period) and staking.  They have some crazy rates there like: Hydra (153%), Velo (53%), ORN (22%), KSM (12%), Bepro (11%), Atom (11%)…

Celsius for BTC, ETH, USDC: not really staking but you can earn respectively 6.2%, 5.05% and 10% by holding on Celsius wallet.  Bonus: move at least $400 worth of something to Celsius wallet and you will get a $40 reward.  

Valora/ Celo: if you add Celo Dollars to the Valora wallet, you earn Celo every month.  Right now the thresholds are: $1 in Celo for   10 cUSD held, 5 for 100, 10 for 500.

Gemini: has a decent earn program with lots of coins, example rates: Dai (7%), Fil (7%), Aave (5.8%), BCH (4.2%)…

Updates based on comments:

r/Swissborg for BTC (9%), ETH(7%), CHSB(10%) and USDC (18%)

YouHodler for EURS (12%)

The deFI wallet of crypto.com has a nice rate for CRO (14%)

Algorand and polkadot have decent staking returns (6% for ALGO on Coinbase for instance)

ONE has 11-12% APY on their mainnet

Binance and Kraken have a lot of staking options

It sounds like this is trusting an exchange rather than any trustless method but I don't get the concept entirely. I'm seeing guaranteed 7%+ returns and a bit suspect about that though. If I stake, is this really a guarantee?"

3. They keep saying something about BETH and not ETH and it has my brain twisted.

Crime is crime and this will probably be less about compliance and more about government control in being able to control the lever.

When the government still hasn’t resolved poker’s Black Friday I doubt crypto will become any more favourable as an outcome for the users, ironic this generally comes only after the largest institutions made out like robbers and thieves. Wall Street and their quants were behind most of the largest defi drains but this regulation won’t hinder them from operating in the space: this regulation is for protecting those with the resources and won’t be in favouring the general public. If our officials really cared they would just enforce the already ignored corruption and fraud rather than creating more cases for resource rich organisations to exploit loopholes that those with economic disparities cannot.

With strong U.S. home building expected to last for several years, lumber prices will likely remain above $500 per 1,000 board feet for the next five to eight years, said Scott Reaves, forest operations director at Domain Timber Advisors.

“We’re at a new normal,” Reaves said in a phone interview. “We’re going to see this sustained level of housing demand and a new normal for a pricing floor in lumber.”"

And although i don't have any strong conviction in the demise of the US dollar or economy, you didn't really give any convincing or compelling reasons as to why rising inflation won't be a problem. Your argument is essentially 1) They are trying to stop it from happening, 2) wood is getting cheaper 3) They can just borrow more money 4) Japan did it."
2021-07-13,"Lumber prices were not high because of inflation - you cant use that argument.   It rose like mad because of shuttered mills (covid) and the CA border being closed.  

Inflation can be stopped by lowering the velocity of money, which can be done by raising interest rates, causing people to park their money in bank accounts.  The fed cannot raise interest rates because the interest payments on our debt is MORE than the annual tax base.  The fed is trapped.  Everyone knows it.

Lastly, inflation in food costs is ALREADY causing riots.  Look at South Africa today.   With all due respect - I don't think you or anyone can speculate on what's coming."

Seems logical that the sell offs and dips around this time would be exponentially bigger year after year as institutional investments become a bigger percentage of the market cap.

Execute sell offs early to mid Dec, book your profits, let the major dips and wrecked portfolios cause major FUD and sell offs with retail investors causing further drops, then institutions buy back their positions in January at a even lower prices.

HODL, and buy more at these beautiful sale prices, kids."

The funniest part is the doge network is fucked at 8cents and people were talking about it going to $1. Even if enough people wanted to buy at $1 to make it $1, they’d never actually be able to buy because the network would be so clogged up."

Bash on the idiots telling people to think that doge is an investment."
2021-01-31,It isn't fair to the dogecoin community to be associated with the shills that have just appeared.
2021-01-31,"Much Pump, Such shills wow"
2021-01-31,It's pretty sad to see pump and dumpers with zero knowledge about crypto ruining so much of Reddit. Thank you to the mods here for keeping this community mostly free of that garbage.
2021-01-31,"Please don't project it on the whole doge community.
The doge community is fun, accommodating and a real community. 
We can't help that this hype has come about and it will go away as soon as the hyper are gone.
Besides the community, Doge has a good mechanism and ownership is, as with everything, a matter of attitude. 
Sure, you used to hear ""to thw moon"" a lot, but show me any crypto where it's not said.
I love my doge, and I like to donate it to people who have helped me, amused me, etc.

So bottom line: please don't bash everyone just because a few hyper people do straight things.

2021-01-31,I think you fail to realize we all think this is a meme anyway (most of us) and most only put $20-$50 into it for the hell of it. If it goes it goes either way it’s a value so minuscule to my total portfolio that I can take the risk of having fun buying a doggie-themed crypto.
2021-01-31,"Worse, I mod r/povertyfinance and every hour we are removing GME and Bitcoin farming posts and our sub rate has rocketed over 100k in the last week. It's annoying because people seem to only see the word finance, sub, don't read the rules and post about throwing life savings into doge, ignorant that it's a sub about... surviving on low to no income at the poverty level and how to make ends meet. These folks are asking where the food banks are. They don't have the money to even think of investing... WTH. 

I will be relieved when this calms down."

2021-05-21,We definitely need more people like Vitalik in the cryptosphere. Appreciate him!
2021-05-21,All I see is big whales having too much control over the value of this asset. All they have to do is sell and they can buy back at a discount.
2021-05-21,"And yet here are the ""big guys"" manipulating the market yet again."
2021-05-21,A good dude who doesn't seem to be greedy and wants to force change. Need alot more people like him if we're going to survive as a species.

2021-05-21,lol. crypto isn't going to do much more than create a new set of big guys and little guys ...
2021-05-21,Good quote to remember when a certain crypto subreddit starts worshiping an overrated biollionaire with an ego problem.
2021-05-21,Sad thing is big institutions are going to be the ones that get the massive profits in the end even with crypto. Pretty much general population is still in the dark about crypto sure there’s news sure there’s talk about it but only select few are actually willing to drop a few grand on crypto. So with these dips big companies are gobbling up giant amounts of crypto and like I said in the end they will be seeing most of the profits and control.
2021-05-21,"Now that he is one of the big boys, let's see how this will age.

A good billionaire is a myth; I don't expect him to remain unchanged in his ideals with that swath of cash hanging around his belt or that he is the developer of Ethereum.

I can commend his intellect and vision to make the network. But now he's the big guy, what will he say to the small guys now? What got him up there won't necessarily hold him up there.

Yes, I am an unpleasant person at parties. I'm saying this is a beginning to putting someone on top a pedestal. We all knew what happened when there are too many people praised Elon Musk."
2021-05-21,"But its not actually empowering anyone. Just about every network is just as imbalanced as the traditional economies. Just simply *using* the network is not ""empowering"" except to the people who disperse the coins.  

PoS only exacerbates this problem, where the wealthiest pseudo anonymous validators will remain so, *forever*. Im sure that's great for Vitalik and his stack.

You will never empower people with a libertarians wet dream. You will only ever empower a small amount of people at the top. Everyone wants to think they are going to be a winner when they are already losers on the network and will always be such.  

Id be interested to see what he would say if he hadn't received his shiny pre mine. Its easy to say its empowering when you are at the top of the pyramid."

2021-05-21,Thanks Vitalik. But we're being terrorized by whales and other Elons. So reality bites for us little men.
2021-05-21,"Ok, I'm new to crypto. How am I empowered by having Ethereum?"
2021-05-21,"At this rate, I can see Vitalik being nominated for a Nobel price sometime in the future."
2021-05-21,Haha fuck off. Sounds like the same shit Robinhood came out with when they started. Crypto already taken over by big money.
2021-05-21,Your only a little guy until you become a big guy but good on him
2021-05-21,we are replacing the big guys with lots of little guys that will eventually become big guys and do similar things to what the old big guys did except behind much more efficient systems.

2021-10-03,IRS should use that money to investigate boat owners with terrible track records instead
2021-10-03,Monero is one of the few coins that I’d be surprised if it didn’t make it.  Too important to fail.

2021-05-31,"Got into crypto in Feburary 2020, so just before the crash. And I instantly rebought BTC when it hit like 4k€. Same with Eth, got most of mine at that time between 120 and 250€. Was hella worth since then!"
2021-05-31,"I only invest after serious consideration and a lot of research. I have seen some gains in ETH, mostly losses in BTC, and been \*really\* happy with ADA.

2021-05-31,"Agreed.  Something I bring up everytime someone says they are just waiting for a crash to buy.

Most won't.  It is mentally tough to buy when everyone else is freaking out.   Some will buy but most talking about it won't."

2021-05-31,"I bought March 16th...  I tossed in $500.  Everyone was saying Bitcoin was dead because it was correlating with the market.  If it was truly a store of value, it would go up when the market went down.  I watched in amazement for an entire month as it climbed before I put anything else in.  

I bought my first ETH on Sept. 23rd standing in a field installing a tiny home.  The price dipped below $325 and my buy order triggered.  I had buyer’s remorse the rest of the day thinking the $ would have been better spent toward BTC.

My first shitcoin was DOGE during the first push to get it over one cent...  I tossed in $100 and assumed it was just throwing money away for fun.  Incidentally, I noted this push on WSB and was banned for 90 days... forcing me to look for alternative subs.

Only a couple months ago did I start accumulating ADA, MATIC, ALGO, VET, NANO, XYO.  Every time I have assumed I was throwing money away, but so far even in the gigantic dip this month, I am still far in the green and am continuing to DCA every week into all of these coins except DOGE."

2021-03-02,I’d like to know y’alls thoughts on JRNY crypto’s channel? Shill or not?
2021-03-02,Any thoughts on Benjamin Cowen? I feel he's the best right now
2021-03-02,"Coin Bureau is good for understanding some concepts if you are new to the space and he does a decent job of explaining what some promising projects bring to the table.

Benjamin Cowen is one of the few crypto youtubers I have any respect for. His analyses are usually on point but he's very much focused on technical analysis. He covers very little fundamental analysis on his channel, especially so during a bull market. He doesn't do microcaps and he's focused on accumulating and investing in projects with solid fundamentals during bear markets. He urges against FOMOing into the market and is realistic about corrections so some people label him a bear but it couldn't be further from the truth. I highly recommend watching him if you want level headed, objective analyses, though he mainly only covers top 20 coins with a major focus on BTC, ETH, LINK, ADA and DOT. You also start to learn a bit about TA as you watch him. Definitely recommended."
2021-03-02,"Digital asset news is very good. He doesn’t shill coins often (if at all), and is very conservative with his predictions."
2021-03-02,The only one i watch is Guy from CoinBureau
2021-03-02,"#Pump'n'Dump Discord groups have one purpose: buy bags for a week, then offload on you during the ""pump"""
2021-03-02,"Crypto Daily : down-to-earth, likeable, meme skills are interstellar, knowledgeable, doesn’t PnD anything just reports his outlook on the cryptospace which is pretty informative a lot of times, all around good dude."
2021-03-02,I’m looking at you Ivan on Tech
2021-03-02,"I regularly watch 2 that I find very good and informative: CryptosRUs and InvestAnswers. Both aren't huge channels, but are very informative and I think both offer very good information without shilling.

But yep, I still get lots of recommendations on my Youtube wall of people pulling stupid shocked faces and gamer faces and it's an instant turn-off. If a channel has a Youtube thumbnail of shocked face, it's an instant delete for me as likely it's just crap.

You should really do your own research rather than just blindly following along with what somebody else says. If you genuinely like a project and feel you can get behind it then why not, but don't just buy 6,000 of some shitcoin because some GamerFace told you to."
2021-03-02,The only youtubers I watch hardly ever make price predictions and are generally focused on analysis of logarithmic charts.
2021-03-02,"You are lumping all crypto youtubers together with this post and it simply isn’t true for all of them. I’m new to the space and some of these Youtubers have helped me understand crypto immensely. Most tokens I have seen hyped on these channels have gone up in value since I entered the space. I have made $$ based on some of these tokens they are “shilling”. 

That being said you do have to DYOR and not just blindly take their advice as it is your real money you’re investing. Yes some youtubers are cringe with their content but most pump and dumps I have seen are typically on Reddit/Twitter or some other social media outlet."
2021-03-02,Totally agree.. so what’s your preferred method to take in quality information and analysis?
2021-05-30,If your employer has a 401k match it’s a risk free 100% return on investment. You can’t beat that
2021-05-30,I ignored 401k in my 20s when my company offered 6% matching. We got acquired and now hardly do 2%. Don't be me - invest in yourself ASAP.
2021-05-30,I have one of those fake rocks I keep a $20 in for retirement!
2021-05-30,This is to all the people here who think diversification means owning 28 different shitcoins.

2021-05-30,Roth Ira is beautiful
2021-05-30,I dont live in the US and have no idea what 401k but going all in crypto is definately ill advised.
2021-05-30,"Yep, diversify your investments doesn't only mean buying différents coins.
But 401k and IRAs are only available in the USA. 
If you don't live there, try to search for equivalents in your own country."
2021-05-30,All about risk management. 401k is essential.
2021-05-30,Totally agree. Diverse investments are necessary. I can imagine this is really hard to imagine for young people especially today as wages have gone totally flat and real estate is impossible in many places.
2021-05-30,"> I realize this is going to be hugely unpopular here..

This is reasonable advice, and it’s likely going to be quite popular here. (I don’t recall seeing a rash of “anti traditional retirement vehicle” posts on this sub recently.)"
2021-05-30,"I invest in:

* Employer-matched 401k *and* HSA
* SEP-IRA via side gig work
* Traditional IRA
* Selling options for a little ""passive"" income
* Crypto

*In That Order.*

If you're putting everything into this asset ... yeeesh."
2021-05-30,"Not saying this is bad advice, but we aren't all from the US here. Also, this seems like the opposite of what Crypto is about. This is written from a perspective only seeing crypto as a profit maker, not actually valuing it's future potential."
2021-05-30,You also forgot health care savings account.   If you have HSA matching you can make a lot as well as once the balance is high enough you can trade stocks with it and roll it into an ira.
2021-05-30,"Do we think IRAs will include crypto in the future? You can already go into bonds, precious metals, etc with IRAs, why not crypto once it’s more adopted"
2021-05-30,"I'm split roughly 33% across 401k, Roth, and crypto. I also sell a few things on Facebook marketplace, so I guess you could call me a high level investor, entrepreneur, or even a mogul."
2021-05-30,Can't save for retirement if I can't buy a house or pay off my student loans yet. And none of my three jobs offers 401k matching. 🤡🤡🤡
2021-05-30,No way dude. My crypto is going to 100000000000000x next week. I put $15.34 in it.
2021-05-30,Short sighted*

2021-08-11,"You would not see that much. You will see that they send some amount of money to some place... But this does not help to guess wether or not the money is wasted.  Sending 1M$ to a company that build road does not give you any information if the money is used to build a new road, repair an old one or thrown away into some stupid thing. 
Second the number of operation would be absolutely terrific. I work in a univ of 13000 student. The number of operation is already enormous just to manage ordinary operations. I cannot imagine how many operations are conducted at the overall state level.

As individual operation are hardly manageable due to their number, having summarized data would be maybe more helpful...and I think the gouvernement budget is avalaiable in many countries. In France we have 'cour des comptes' that audit gouvernement money management and triggers warning when they feel it is necessary to do so (they do so every year in their report)."
2021-08-11,This could be one of the long term benefits of CBDCs if they are implemented correctly

-Low inflation rate, or maximum supply

-Years in development

-Recent drops in price to catch the dip

This isn't a difinitive list, but its definitely good key factors to look for. Never buy a crypto when its at an all time high, there is a chance it keeps going up, but theres more of a chance that the price will drop sooner than you think.

Theres other things to look for, like price history, whats trending on social media, etc.

2021-05-15,"I'm surprised at the lack of reading comprehension in the comments here. To add emphasis to OPs point:

***THE INDIVIDUAL PRICE OF A COIN DOES NOT REFLECT ITS POTENTIAL UPSIDE.***

1 ADA = $2.20;
1 DOGE = $0.51

Just because 1 DOGE is a quarter of the price of 1 ADA, does that mean DOGE has that much room more to grow? No - they have similar market caps of ~$70bn - all things being equal the market values each project about the same. 

1 AAVE = $560, but it's Mcap is only $7bn - in this market it has more room to grow than either ADA or DOGE. 

Of course this is extremely simplified and doesn't take into account inflationary tokenomics, use-cases etc, but doing so would make individual coin price even more irrelevant. 

If you must take a back-of-the-napkin view, focus on market cap and leave coin price behind (except for marking personal buy/sell milestones once you understand each coins tokenomics)."

No. It doesn’t. A $12B market cap does not mean that there is $12B in it. Most people bought at prices that were wildly different than the current price.

The second half of that sentence is correct. Market cap allows us to compare the relative size of different coins. It is a measurement of theoretical value, and not much else.

Edit: It can also be very difficult to tell how practical the simple method of calculating market cap really is. For example, an estimated 20% of all bitcoins have been lost in wallets with no apparent owners. Should these count towards the market cap? I’d say that’s a tough one—the answer is not obvious."
2021-05-11,"While you're not wrong, a few additional things about market cap:

* Anybody could go make some garbage coin that reaches $1 million in a few hours. Market cap is a little arbitrary if that can occur.

* What did they expect the market cap of bitcoin to be 10 years ago? Was it this high? Or have cryptocurrencies far exceeded everyone's expectations? Market cap is pretty arbitrary."

2021-05-11,"Great. Another post about Market Cap that doesn't understand how it works. But since this place is a circlejerk of misunderstanding... 6k upvotes here we come!!!!

EDIT: Many folks asked for an explanation for what's wrong with OPs comment, and others have come to the rescue to explain it. 

Let me give my own as well by way of example.

Let's say you decide to make a coin: MarsCoin (I hope it doesn't exist, i didn't check) and you find 100 others, either collaborators, or uneducated investors, to join you. You create 1 trillion coins and tell the others that this coin for X reason will be worth $10 in no time, believe you me. 

You then put up 100 coins for sale at a price of $1. One of the other 100 buy one of the coins for $1. At that very moment MarsCoin has a ""Market Cap"" of $1 trillion dollars because market cap is a calculation of all coins multiplied by the last sale price ($1 x 1 trillion). 

If those 100 start to believe their own hype, they start trading more and more of these coins at $1 and then $1.10 amongst themselves and the market cap starts to go up substantially. No significant money EVER entered the market, but the market cap make it seem like there has.

This is a simple example of how market cap is calculated, and is not to explain why SHIB will hit $10 or will not hit $10. The price a coin will hit depends is largest part on demand, and a smaller part on supply. A large circulating supply will put downward pressure on price in the long run, but in the short run, in a bull market, it all depends on the collective euphoria of those buying it."
2021-05-11,So something with a low market cap and a lower number of available coins is something that might be worth looking into? I know that's overly simplistic but might be an ok place to start
2021-05-11,"While I'm not in disagreement with the general sentiment you're trying to get across, that a coin with 400 trillion tokens is unlikely to reach .10 cent, especially a meme coin.

You also need to understand that market capitalization says NOTHING about how much money is in a coin.  As you said yourself, its simply circulating supply \* price. People in crypto, and especially new people in crypto often get by confused by the concept of price in the crypto markets.

Its not like in when you walk into a shop to buy a new computer, and every new computer is priced the same and the price rarely changes - so you can simply multiply the amount of sold computers with the price to calculate how much money have been spent on those computers.  Price is determined as the average price across all trading pairs on all exchanges for that coin, different exchanges and different trading pairs may calculate this differently - some exchanges use the median of the spread between the lowest sell offer and the highest buy offer, other exchanges simply use the last sold item as reference for price - and then some exchanges may list price in USDC, others in BUSD, and others yet again in USDT if its for a CRYPTO/CRYPTO trading pair.

This means that the price isn't actually an accurate reflection of the price for every coin in circulation, and in some cases its not even an accurate reflection of the last traded coin as the orderbooks could potentially move without any trades taking place.

Using marketcap as a measurement for 'how much money' as in fiat is in the coin, or in crypto as a whole is a logical fallacy - because since the price is not actually an accurate representation, it also means the marketcap isnt an accurate representation.

Thats why $100 entering the market in a coin with low liquidity could potentially change the marketcap $1,000,000,000, or $100,000 exiting the market in a coin with high sell pressure compared to buy pressure could wipe out $30,000,000 from the marketcap.

Yes its fun to look and compare marketcaps between coins on coinmarketcap and coingecko, but its also important to keep in mind that these marketcaps are in fact completely arbitrary and is NOT an accurate representation of the market or market sentiment.  You should NOT use marketcaps as a serious form of measurement of ANY coin, and neither should you make trading decisions based on it.

Circulating supply IS a very useful piece of information, but marketcaps are extremely hypothetical and dont really provide any useful information.

If you want to make good trading decisions in crypto you must rather look at volume and how it relates to price, tokenomics and technicals of the coin.  How these evolve over time is what will give you an idea of what to expect once the crypto markets start having more stable liquidity as adoption grows."

>What does it tell us? It lets us know how much money is in it, and how it compares to other coins.Take SHIB for an example. It has a circulating supply of 400 trillion tokens, so at its price of 0.003¢, it has a market cap of nearly $12 BILLION.

If I mint 1 billion tokens, give 999,999,999 to 0x...dead and trade one to my friend for $10, it does not mean the token has a market cap of $10 billion, nor that there is $10 billion in it. This is what SHIB did.

They gave a massive supply of token to a user they know won't touch it, effectively making that token ""out of circulation"". The moment that token is touched, the value of the token will plummet because of the sudden introduction of massive amounts into circulation.

Many of the memes were created to build viral hype for pump and dump scams. HODL is one of the oldest and most famous. It was telling people to buy and hold an over-hyped coin so insiders on the scam could dump the coin and make money. It is quite brazen because the market is essentially unregulated.

There are groups of professionals making money on pump and dump scams daily in crypto. They will be highly active on Reddit and any other forum to push their scams. They are specialists in driving engagement and hype. They will create and promote as many memes as they can, and a few will stick around.

I’m not saying every hype meme in crypto is a scam, but many of them are. A big part of the “culture” is scammers trying to make a buck. People do like memes, so they draw a crowd of onlookers."

Same thing can happen with an nft - I mean, you'll have your nft and still ""own"" it, but without their server it won't mean anything.  Your ""ownership"" doesn't trump them, or force them to do anything for you.  They'll still be able to ban / restrict / rebalance however they want, and can delete it, ban you, or remove it from your account.  In the case of a game the server is the source of truth, the blockchain is just a receipt.

Owning an nft means a lot less when the nft its self isn't actually the thing you ""own.""  Like all the nft art that are just url links - once the server goes down your nft goes with it.  This is actually nothing like crypto currency because owning the coin in the blockchain is all that matters for crypto - owning an nft for an asset that isn't actually held within the nft is just using the blockchain as a ledger.

This sir, with that technology, is an impossible and a false statement.

In reality nothing is stoping or avoiding than any NFT reference link (because that is what is in the blockchain) dies and what is owned for the NFT owner will become nothing at all. As a matter of fact, the protection offered for the NFT system is very fragile at best because of the reference vulnerability and would certainly won't be economically viable for massive purchase of setted prices items like the ones on a marketplace because of the fuel costs required to put something in the blockchain, saying this show a deep missunderstanding of this technology sir.

As the forums grew, people saw opportunity and that was the nail in the coffin. Capitalism tries to squeak out every penny from a given subculture and it ruins the charm that made it fun to begin with.




I feel that's where we are with video games. Obviously there are some good guys out there who will deliver great products, but the bastardize version of gaming is basically here to stay. Honestly the only reviews I want of a given game, is how incomplete is it, are there microtransactions or pay per content coming down the road. Just let me know the studio cares more about money than making a decent product."
2022-01-05,"I think that the turning point of putting the power in the consumers hands with respect to NFTs in videogames is going to come from NFT projects that are not put out by the game studios, but by projects that are independent, and are able to ""force"" the game studios to support them, by aggregating enough users and or IP.

&#x200B;

Right now there are a couple projects, in the gun space for instance there is Digital Arms ([https://www.hunter-token.com/](https://www.hunter-token.com/)) which is signing up gun manufacturers to license their IP for NFT projects. If a company like this manages to sign up enough big name manufacturers, it will reach a point where a game studio can't put name brand guns in their game without supporting the Digital Arms NFT customers. So no SIG MCX, just some ""piston assault rifle"". Or has enough user base that a game studio would want to attract them by supporting the NFT project.

&#x200B;

I think that when a consumers weapons, and skins, and accessories are all viewed as personal property, and not tied to a particular game, or game studio, we will start seeing the gaming community understand the benefit and power of NFTs, and stop viewing them as just another profit seeking move from game companies."

2021-09-15,"Save a click:


- Sen. Elizabeth Warren criticized high fees on the ethereum network during times of heightened trading volatility.
- ""Small investors could easily get jammed and wiped out entirely,"" she said in a Senate committee hearing Tuesday.
- Warren said outages on crypto exchanges last week could have hit people who don't have the money to lose.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren has criticized the high fees on ethereum's network during heightened trading volatility, arguing they could substantially harm small investors.

Ethereum network fees can change rapidly, largely because the blockchain uses a blind auction system to set them. Users must put in bids to have their transaction processed and verified by miners. That rivalry means fees can soar when the network is busy.

""In the face of these high, unpredictable fees, small investors could easily get jammed and wiped out entirely,"" Warren said in remarks to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler at the US Senate Banking Committee Hearing on Tuesday.

The senator's comments were centered on the sell-off in cryptocurrency markets last week, the same day El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender. She put forward a scenario of wanting to buy a hypothetical token worth $100 at that time to illustrate her point about fees.

""The fee to swap between two crypto tokens on the ethereum network was more than $500, obviously way more than the $100 I was trying to trade in the first place,"" she said.

The way fees were calculated on the ethereum network changed with the London upgrade, codenamed EIP-1559. But the aim wasn't to necessarily make them cheaper - only to make them more predictable.

Warren, chair of the Senate's banking committee, is one of many lawmakers concerned that a lack of centralized authorities in the crypto industry means small investors have almost no protection and could get badly burned.

She previously called on Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to act, saying there was a need for a cohesive regulatory strategy to moderate the escalating risks that cryptocurrencies pose to the financial system.

During the sell-off, some of the biggest crypto exchanges faced outages, blocking customers from making withdrawals. That could have had an impact on people who don't have money to lose, Warren said.

""Advocates say crypto markets are all about financial inclusion,"" she said to Gensler. ""But the people who are most economically vulnerable are the ones who are most likely to have to withdraw their money the fastest when the market drops. Does this sound like the path to financial inclusion to you?""

Gensler raised the pressure on crypto exchanges Tuesday, saying they need to register with the regulator because some of their tokens or products may be securities."
2021-09-15,"The whole ""bring the market under government regulations"" movement is so incredibly cynical and unprincipled, that it boggles the mind.

For example, the securities laws enacted in the name of ""protecting retail investors"" actually protect venture capital firms from competition for early stage investment opportunities. Ethereum's initial token sale in 2015, was not subject to securities laws, and thus was directly to the public, allowing the non-rich to see 3000X+ gains over the last six years.

Ever since the SEC entered the cryptocurrency market in late 2017 to ""protect"" investors from token sales, permissionless token sales have disappeared, and all the early stage investment opportunities have been monopolized by VCs who have seen MASSIVE gains by getting tokens like SOL and FLOW at prices below $0.05, and who now own one third to one half of all the tokens of these platforms:

In other words, the SEC and the securities laws that frauds like Warren promote have contributed to massively greater wealth inequality in the cryptocurrency space."
2021-09-15,Well she is not wrong about the fees
2021-09-15,Let the free market chose. No one needs to pay those fees.
2021-09-15,The fees are very high. Maybe you should move on to a topic you understand
2021-09-15,Ok so hear me out… maybe we should all be very concerned with high network fees and exchange outages?
2021-09-15,"Thats me that she is concerned for; the small investor. Maybe one of the smallest in the market. Even not considered as an investor actually, I could just be an investee."

2021-09-15,"i mean isn't she somewhat right about the fees though? I know that eth gas fees aren't always high as right now, but the high fees do make small transactions less desirable."
2021-09-15,"Everyone one has a choose to use ethereum and pay high gas fees. You can even search how high the gas fees are. Any small investor that doesn't want to pay high gas fees has other ecosystems to choose from. It's a choose the investor makes for him/her self, not a choose Elizabeth Warren makes for them."
2021-05-24,What's a few pullbacks between friends?
2021-05-24,And he's completely right.
2021-05-24,This is one of the darker side of mass adoption: uneducated investors coming in and having no clue how a market works.

2021-05-24,"Short term crypto gains are cool, but real gains come from holding for years.

If you want 4 or 5 digits gains, move your crypto on a hardware wallet or a wallet where you control the private key, stop looking at the chart, forget about it and come back to it in a year or 2."
2021-05-24,He's right. The problem is that every forum was full of diamond hand and rocket emojis for months. Everybody was an expert and everybody was a hodler and everybody said you should buy the dip. People bought in with money they needed or didn't even have. These voices are gone now.
2021-05-24,He has a point. High risk high rewards I guess. Still hoping Ada’s smart contracts will be released soon
2021-05-24,"Of course, but the question is how big the pullbacks will be. In the last bear market ADA pulled back from $1.29 to under $0.03, which was an unusually big crash even for that period. So far this time it's holding up reasonably OK."
2021-05-24,Price could go up... could go down..
2021-05-24,"At the same time though, over the course of the last 10 days we have had numerous attacks on bitcoin.

Elon musk

2021-05-24,I didn't know this when I first enter crypto in 2018. lol.
2021-05-24,"Problem here is, most people are dumb as hell and think thats exactly how it works. and once they realize it doesnt they go in full panic mode and sell their stuff just to buy Back in when the prize is way up again"
2021-05-24,"I'm not pissed that there's an ebb and flow, that's always expected.

I'm pissed that a billionaire posts a few tweets to manipulate a market for his rich friends. I'm pissed that the Chinese gov is trying to crash BTC. I'm pissed that I finally learn how to use TA on ZEC and just as I buy a dip at 244 expecting it to hit 285, I wake up to it at 142.

This is still just ""play money"" to me, it's a fucking hobby to occupy my time and learn from my mistakes. But when foreign governments and rich assholes fuck with my money when that's what I'm trying to get away from in the first place, yeah, I'm pretty pissed."
2021-05-24,"This is indeed a good reminder for new entrants.

The cryptocurrency market is the only truly free market in the world.

Users are constantly able to find the equilibrium price. This implies that volatility is part of the game.

You have to accept that investors can react disproportionately to the rise or fall.

It is obvious that it is easier to manage an increase of +30% in a few hours than a decrease of -30% in a few hours.

Nevertheless, that is part of the game.

Those who will benefit from the cryptocurrency market in the coming years will be those who have adapted a long-term vision. This helps to avoid giving in to panic by letting emotions get the better of your sense of logical reasoning."

Edit: Adding a new financial education tweet she just made that really drives home a point that a lot of us here have been making for years; that financial education desperately needs to be taught in our schools so students don't start off life with a financial literacy handy cap when it comes to things like how the cash system, loan system, and credit system work, etc. That way, they don't fall for predatory student loans, or any kind of predatory financial practice aiming to trick them into making very expensive mistakes: [https://twitter.com/AarikaRhodes/status/1412867352744501248?s=20](https://twitter.com/AarikaRhodes/status/1412867352744501248?s=20)"

In December 2017, eight former aides to Sherman said that his offices in Washington, D.C., and California had a toxic environment characterized by frequent ""verbal abuse from the congressman and senior staff that made them feel bullied and demoralized.""[105] A focus of the criticism was Matt Dababneh, Sherman's district director and a close advisor,[105] who began working for Sherman in 2005 and became district director to Sherman in 2009.[106] Dababneh was elected to the California State Assembly in 2013,[106] and resigning from that body after allegations of sexual assault and other misconduct were made against him.[105] Former employees in Sherman's office told the Los Angeles Times that Dababneh frequently made inappropriate sexual remarks, including degrading and sexist comments, and bragged about his sexual exploits.[105] No one suggested that Sherman knew of Dababneh's conduct, but several staffers said that the office environment did not encourage reporting and said that Sherman would not have been receptive to complaints about a trusted advisor.[105]"

Especially when you actually own the NFT on a blockchain distributed among millions of computers and are not just relying on a database entries on some company's centralized servers."

""You mean they actually vote for the lizards?""

""Oh yes,"" said Ford with a shrug, ""of course.""

""But,"" said Arthur, going for the big one again, ""why?""

""Because if they didn't vote for a lizard,"" said Ford, ""the wrong lizard might get in. Got any gin?""

""What?""

""I said,"" said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, ""have you got any gin?""

](https://search.brave.com/search?q=Population+of+el+salvador&source=desktop)

Everyone who registers in the Chivo wallet gets $30 worth of BTC.
Which means that 0.7 x 6,408,111 x 30 = $134,570,331 in BTC free to people.

The value of that Bitcoin was likely more than their gold holdings just a few weeks ago when the price was higher.

The gov't seems hell bent on buying more and more Bitcoin, thus exposing the national treasury to more and more risk. Bukele can gamble like that, but international lenders like the IMF aren't going to want to lend. So it's a risk.

2021-04-06,"India has been threatening to ban crypto for the last 7 years. They have never done it. To do so now would be political suicide. This is blustering (as other govts have done) because they don't have a policy and cannot agree on a policy. 

It's too late. People have already voted with their apps, dApps, Smart Contracts and NFTs.  In very small and very big ways, the crypto journey has given billions of people all over the planet the chance to change their paradigm - from micro-earnings like faucets, PTCs etc to the entire basket of financial opportunities that crypto has opened up.  Ancient thinking has always been usurped by technology. It's a matter of how, not if."

They pulled the same thing last November by demonetizing the 500 and 1000 rupee notes; they are trying to force people to use banks and traditional financial institutions so they can tax more easily. It hasn't worked so far. It's a shame that India, a country that could so easily be flourishing, is pouring money into weapons development, banning crypto, and generally looking backwards when they should be looking forwards."

2021-06-22,"*Glauber Contessoto says that he invested over $250,000 in dogecoin on Feb. 5 with a belief that he’d become a millionaire* 

250k into dogecoin?!"
2021-06-22,"So this dude put in 250k at ~.05 and not only passed up the .40 mark when he 8x his investment, but then passed up .70 where he would have 14x his investment less than a month later? 

I don't think this dude wants to be a millionaire, or he could have taken it out at any of those times and still played with house money."
2021-06-22,I mean he's still up more than 3x. Yes doge is a memecoin and investing 250k seems insane to me but the man gambled and won
2021-06-22,"Classic case of an investor moving the goal posts. ""My investment goal is to become a millionaire"" *becomes millionaire* ""okay w-w-well i'll sell 10% when it reaches TEN MILLION! That totally was the plan all along, guys""."
2021-06-22,"Dude hit the jackpot of a lifetime and didn't even take back his initial investment because he believed Doge will increase in value from then until 2022. He lived like a bum, where he sold all of his stocks, liquidated his 401(k), and drive a piece of junk all so he can put it all into Doge. The dude made it big, but he is losing almost all of it by not taking out investments or profit!"
2021-06-22,"But but but but….

You’re not a millionaire if you don’t sell. Same goes for when the markets tank: you’re not losing money if you don’t sell. 

Paper gains and paper losses make paper tigers."
2021-06-22,"Well, will he sell when he is back down to 250k?"
2021-06-22,"Dogecoin went parabolic. It defied all conventional wisdom. He caught lightning in a bottle and played himself. Even if this market correction ends, Doge is going to struggle to get back to where it was."
2021-06-22,"You have to take a least some profit, people saying they’re holding forever are dumb."
2021-06-22,"He bet everything on 1 number on the roulette wheel and was lucky enough for it to hit. 

Now he can’t walk away from the table while his winnings disappear."
2021-06-22,"When you win the lotto, cash out"
2021-06-22,"Good for him. But holding Doge which was intended to just be a joke seems really stupid to me.

I have nothing against the coin, but expecting to make millions off it is incredibly dumb. It could go back to 1 cent and nothing really changes for Doge. It isn't used anywhere near as much as the top coins. Fundamentals may not matter when everything is in full bull mode, but long term, they do."
2021-06-22,There is nothing wrong with taking profits and buying in at lower cost. There is some expensive lessons being learned by new investors who haven’t gotten good investing advice. It’s a cool story to hold and look cool. It’s even cooler to be a millionaire and actually not have many worries while your money works for you. It’s mind blowing why people don’t take profits.
2021-06-22,"This HODL mentality only works in BTC. It is flawed when applied to DOGE. Without utility, the memecoin is only as strong as the meme. Memes are tied to time periods. Doge will age like mayonnaise."
2021-06-22,"Alternative title:

This 33-year-old dogecoin investor refuses to sell despite gaining over $583,000 in four months."
2021-06-22,He is still a dogenaire
2021-06-22,So 16 percent? That’s nothing.
2021-06-22,"I mean, DFV lost $14M in one day and held."

2021-03-12,$88 ETH hurts my soul.
2021-03-12,"I remember thinking I would obviously hold, but feeling skeptical about buying more... seriously. It was unclear if I would be able to continue to work. We got $3600 in stimulus and I worked out a deal for 90 days rent with it. I obviously realized much later that I could have got nearly a whole bitcoin for it. But I held all my crypto and made out like a bandit in the end. I sold about 80% of my btc yesterday and my wife and I are closing on our 1st property on 4/2. Crypto is an amazing opportunity and a wild ride but you gotta keep eyes on your target."

>Just sell the last of your coins before they are worth zero.

2021-03-12,My shitcoins didn't want to fill me with regret for not buying more so they remained the same value since then.

2021-03-12,I know a few people that still didn't want to get in because it was expensive.
2021-11-04,My sentiments exactly. Far too many people are approaching meme coins like they're all supposed to hit the lottery.
2021-11-04,"If you invested $2 in winning Powerball numbers yesterday, you'd be up 7,300,000,000% That's 1.3x10^2870 APY. 01-02-24-50-57-26 token is the hottest thing out there."
2021-11-04,99.9999999% of meme coins fail. Nothing wrong with gambling as long as you know that’s what you’re doing and it’s done responsibly

2021-11-04,I prefer my gambling to take place in an actual casino. At least playing blackjack I can adjust my odds and my bets in real-time. When it comes to crypto I prefer long term bets. Not an all in blind gamble.
2021-11-04,"Proud Robodoge holder here. My 40$ investment went up to 300$. Right now is 9$ LoL. 
Smart ass devs designed AI called Aria, and that bitch allows you to sell only portion of your investment. For example if Aria is set to 20% you can sell only 20% of your investment. It supposed to be anti panic sell system that doesn’t allow people to sell due to market crash etc. Sounded cool in the beginning, but after some time Aria dropped down to 1% which made impossible to sell anything while devs where cashing out claiming it’s for marketing purposes. Cheap lesson to pay."
2021-11-04,It’s a sort of take on survivor bias. The people that get big gains are more likely to want to post about it and those stories are more likely to get likes. It makes it seems like all of the shit coins are golden.

2021-11-04,Hey finally some original content
2021-11-04,"There's a maasive difference between the shitcoins. Doge/Shib were destined for pumps and dumps at some point with how genuinely massive their fan base is. I've encountered 10 people in doge/shib for every eth/btc holder IRL, and that's probably a conservative ratio in favor of eth/btc. Don't even get me started on the alt market, if it's not ADA/MATIC 99% of people I know who are ""into crypto"" have no idea what it is. The rise of shit coins only proves how early we still are IMO"
2021-11-04,I come here for these types of posts so I don’t FOMO every coin that sparkles my attention for a half second

2022-08-17,"Anyone who thinks Shkreli isn't in on this is out of their minds.

The guy is out of jail for like a week and is connected to the theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars.  

Here is how this goes:  Shkreli has an accomplice upload a RAT-infested torrent.  Shkreli downloads and runs the RAT.  RAT steals the money.  Shkreli splits the money with accomplice.  Shkreli then claims culpable deniability and hopes that the porno aspect of the torrent is embarrassing enough to make people think he wouldn't proactively humiliate himself for free money (which is obviously not true).

Case closed."

2021-12-03,"I used to moderate for a site that featured phone sex, text lines, and custom content like user requested videos. I don't see it happening. Those girls already make a lot of money and very few of them were tech savvy. I used to make good side money editing videos for them and HTML coding their pages to look professional. Some of them didn't even understand how to upload a video.

They'd also make up to 5k in a single week so it would be incredibly difficult to convince them to switch platforms. To me it seems like from their perspective it would be an ""if it aint broke don't fix it"" type of thing.

If there's one thing I know for sure its that I'll never look at middle aged white collar dudes the same way lol."

With that said, I'm continuing to accumulate."

2021-06-27,"I'm actually worried about this turning into a massive shitshow and hurting the entire crypto space. It's cool and all, but this is El Salvador.

2021-12-13,"Obligatory, fuck Ticketmaster"
2021-12-13,Can somebody explain the leap in logic of how NFTs lock in prices for limited venues?
2021-12-13,NFTs will not solve the Ticketmaster fee problem. The issue will still be how many venues Ticketmaster/live nation owns or are partners with.
2021-12-13,Get Protocal are on top of this. Check them out.
2021-12-13,Man it's crazy how shitty Ticketmaster is and still no  competitors can really pop up.
2021-12-13,"I only know of GET protocol that does something similar. But if I'm remembering correctly they are based in the Netherlands. They have lots of customers but i don't think they are branching out too much. 

Looking forward to another crytpo that does something similar"
2021-12-13,"imgonnalevelwithyou. you dont need blockchain for ticketmaster to stop charging fees. they just add fees b/c they know ppl will pay. Selling tickets is not a technologically advanced mechanic, and zero technology has been added from 0 fees 10years ago to current world 7+ fees. I remember getting pissed about the first $2.50 convenience fee, and I stopped going to concerts once those fees totaled $10 b/c i knew it would only get worse."
2021-12-13,"Happy some already mentioned GET Protocol. I've used one of their integrators (GUTS Tickets) and it's simply a great experience in more than 1 way. Transparancy goes such a long way to me, but even if you don't care about blockchain... The usage is supersimple (better actually than ticketmaster), no need for blockchain/crypto know-how.

I mention them every chance I get. GET the word out, make people realise ticketmaster is the bad guy and there's a better alternative around!"
2021-12-13,"> NFTs

> locking in price

lol"
2021-12-13,"Ok ill bite.
Im confused by a lot.

Why do you think they need NFTs to do this instead of just direct sale of tickets. 

Why do you think they NEED the blockchain to do this instead of just direct sale of tickets. I can see it can help some issues but it is not needed, as they used to direct sell tickets in the past.

They used to direct sale of tickets, ticketmaster came onto the scene late 70s , but really early 80s is when it took off. Why did businesses turn over ticket sales from direct sales to ticketmaster?


the main reason ticketmaster became a thing is it was a fully built system that was always on when venues and musicians are NOT always on. In the past you hired temporary untrained workers, where ticketmaster already has the trained staff. because you hired your own staff you pretty much limited people to getting their tickets from the box office or the radio station, with ticket master they gave more options and could sell tickets 24/7. are you going to hire someone to sit in the box office at 3am selling tickets to a slow selling concert? well with someone else doing it you dont have to worry about it.Its like call centers. they are great when your business isnt enough to justify hiring all those people but you still need them.

Fuck ticket master, but artists werent just waiting on a blockchain to do direct sales. Now for sure technology today opens more options than we had in the 70s. Like you could easily sell from more than the box office. You can have a website on 24/7.  And maybe blockchain will be part of sales, but i dont see it as the spear that kills ticketmaster because that has nothing to do with the point of using them. maybe ticketmaster will use a blockchain but a blockchain wont kill ticketmaster."
2021-12-13,GET protocol
2021-12-13,I hate Ticketmaster so much. They literally provide no service other than facilitating a transaction yet charge more in fees than the fuckin ticket sometimes. I cannot wait for something to destroy that shitshow of a company.
2021-12-13,"Don't you guys have TicketSwap by any chance?

I have used it a lot. You can either buy or sell a ticket with a maximum markup of 20% (to reduce scalping), fees are very small. Most people do sell below the original purchase price tho.

I have bought tickets for events such as Defqon.1 and you will get a entirely new ticket with your own name and new bar code.

If I remember correctly, GET Protocol is also working on tickets on the block chain, kinda nice."
2021-12-13,"Hopefully, it's not on Ethereum network.  Having a $200 dollar gas fee to purchase a $74 dollar ticket would be even worse.  Jokes aside I've thought of this exact same thing before and agree, fuck ticket master."
2021-12-13,I think GET Protocol is trying to do this. Might be something to look at. It could be the one to do it.
2021-12-13,"Unfortunately, that won't happen. LiveNation owns Ticketmaster, they own the bulk of all radio stations in the U.S. and they have exclusive contracts with just about every venue that holds more than 2 thousand people.

These are the real reasons they are basically a monopoly, they'll use blockchain for tickets and you'll still be getting ripped off."
2021-12-13,I miss blockbuster. I want to stroll around and look at the movie covers
2021-12-13,The real issue is with the venues. They give ticketmaster this power
2021-12-13,How do you prove you own the ticket? There would have to be some kind of QR code or something that venues could read to let you in. Scalpers could create individual wallets for each ticket and sell you the wallet for the whatever price. At least that's how it works in my naive head. How do you prove you as an individual own the NFT? Obligatory fuck TM I'm just wondering how it would work.

A good starting guide that helps people learn and then adjust to their own style is important to keep them from getting frustrated and quitting or worse, making serious mistakes. 

The most irritating thing I’ve experienced is buying classes and being told the whole time “I’m gonna show you how to do this thing” and instead you spend the whole time getting disjointed “can find on YouTube for free” information. Only to be told at the end after never learning the thing that the thing is in the next level class which is thousands of dollars more than what you paid already. 

Then also told you can use anything you’ve been “taught” without what is in the next level."

2021-11-20,Didn't the validators vote to shut down? The devs didn't just shut down. Solana is also a very new Blockchain so it hasn't had time to become as decentralized. Most chains start out very centralized and become more decentralized over time.

It really is not that big of a deal imho.
What would you prefer? The devs taking their time, releasing a patch after a month and by then nobody caring to even update their nodes, becaus SOL is at 0,00001 cent by then?

But in the long term bear markets, I'm a big advocate for keeping it in cold storage.

There are also inherent risks with media like paper wallets or hardware wallets. Some people think that if you keep it out of exchanges that it's 100% safe. This is false. Stuff like fires, losing the seed or the hardware being hacked. So you have to weigh your risks and keep your wits around you.

2021-02-15,"Could someone please explain the best/most cost effective way to exchange small amounts of cryptos ($50-100) using a non-custodial wallet, eg exodus? Or is it just not cost effective in those quantities?

The % fees on exodus' exchange seem higher than custodial wallets / central exchanges but then there are transaction fees if I want to move crypto to a central exchange like binance and do the exchange there. It's really hard to work out what the most efficient method to swap between something like ADA and DOT or for example to buy any crypto with fiat currency (credit card / banking). There are fees to buy with fiat and then more fees to move it to non custodial. Is there something here I'm missing?

EDIT: it feels like this is an important part of getting started in crypto. Everyone tells you to go non-custodial but then no one explains how to buy/store/move cryptos around with non-custodials without wasting lots of money."

Bitcoin is expected to account for 60% of the total invested, which could add as much as 3% to the cryptocurrency's market value. The survey polled 235 Americans with less than $150,000 in household income.

However I would like to point out the shilling some people might try to do around here and give you a friendly heads up. 

Don't get me wrong. Your investment in crypto is welcome, it will up some of the coins we hold and most people will sell and make a profit. Bitcoin can be 100k in a month. I certainly hope some of my crypto will triple in value on medium term. Your money will help. 

But before you buy at almost all time highs, think about the value of the coin in real world one year from now and then ask yourself how much can you wait when buying a specific crypto and how much you can afford to lose. There are some big whales out there - if they sell while you buy the price will certainly go down quite dramatically. 

And then there are these sh-t coins that some hype just because they own tens of thousands - if you will buy a no value coin at 1$, they can sell it at 1$ while previously buying it at 1 cent. Your 100$ investment will be worth 40$ or less. 

Things can go south and you could lose more than 200$/day. It happens quite often actually and you should not expect to make 500% in a month. It will be far from that and you can turn your 1400$ into 500$, panic, take the loss and leave.  

If you are that kind of person you better put that money into something else. Buy some flowers for your girlfriend, a new computer, phone, tires, recoup on debts or whatever. 
If you can wait and you believe crypto will change the way we use economy and improve our daily life, then welcome to the club."

$50K ETH this year

$2.5K ETH by Valentine's Day

$2-3 ADA by the beginning of this week (he said this last Thursday! lol)

and many, many more pungent delights...

Honestly though, there is no fight to win. People like BitBoy are a dime a dozen in any market. Anyone who is out to really learn how to manage their own wealth will eventually figure out who is and isn't worth listening to. The reality is that most investors will fail with or without BitBoy's help because they don't manage their emotions or sufficiently educate themselves. I don't like him any more than you do, but he's just one of the many obstacles between any other content creator or beginner investor and success, and a relatively insignificant one in the grand scheme of things.

Credit Cards: its not your money. The bank is effectively loaning you credit to buy something, something that has a value and can be (probably) repossessed if you fail to repay. 

Debit Card payment - while its your money, the bank is (in most countries) somewhat liable for losses due to fraud over the internet; some providers ban buying things they think are too risky. 

No bank will stop you doing a wire-transfer into a crypto account though - they can slow you down, but they won't stop you."

Now if they had 💎👐🏼 they would have been fine probably, even with accrued interest.

Credit issuers will also not allow you to pay a debt with another debt instrument. This is why you can't pay a credit card with another credit card.

And all this money is coming out of the same bucket because crypto isn't a closed loop, meaning you don't get paid in crypto and transact in crypto directly, you have to buy it with fiat and when you buy something *with it* the vendor then has to exchange it back to fiat for it to have any real use for them because its not a medium of exchange excepton the very razors edge of the margin.... 

As the economy gets worse and prices keep going up people simply have less money, so you are going to have a lot more sellers than buyers willing to put their fiat into the riskiest of assets when they have to pay 50% more for food and gas and  might lose their job soon.

This is what happens every downturn, people flee risky speculative assets 🤷‍♂️

Its going to get worse, we haven't really seen any layoffs yet but it's going to happen....Crypto is really going to take a shit when that happens because, again, all the money is coming from the same bucket

Money has to be trusted by people to make daily exchanges of goods and services. If you want to see how that works when nobody trusts the money's value, just spend some time in a country like Argentina where the currency collapses every few years."

This is exactly the power of crypto, no authority can dictate about YOUR funds"
2022-03-01,"I don't agree with Warren's views on crypto.

That said, she's not wrong that Russia can be using it to avoid sanctions.

Crypto has also made it easier for people to donate to Ukraine. Obviously that doesn't suit her agenda, but when you refute what she says and push the Ukraine angle, you're doing exactly the same as she is.

You both have valid points, if I hear only yours it leads me to one conclusion, if I hear only hers it leads me to the exact opposite. The reality though is that you can listen to both and still come to the right conclusions.

Having more viewpoints is always a good thing, even if I don't necessarily agree with her conclusions. To be fair, what she said is rather vague too, just ""increase their scrutiny of digital assets"" which could mean nothing more than analyze the block chain to see where they're sending money - which is totally reasonable, although I think we suspect she means more than that.

Who knows, after discussing all of the realities of this situation, maybe there are ideas others have for how we can better enforce sanctions against Russia without banning/regulating crypto. Thus achieving the best of both worlds."
2022-03-01,It’s the nature of crypto. You cannot selectively control who can use and who can’t.
2022-03-01,"I mean it isn’t a non-story of course Russian citizens who have nothing to do with the government will evade sanctions and of course Ukraine will receive support.

2022-03-01,"When she first took on financial reform, it seemed like she was anti-Wall St, which definitely resonated with a lot of people, particularly following the 2008 collapse.

The more she goes on about crypto, it’s clear she’s just pro-regulation."
2022-03-01,"Yes This a inherent attribute of neutral means of exchange. Partisan politics encourages people to take leaps of logic onto that result in several degrees of separation from their original purpose. 

After the effective money freeze that hit Russia’s central bank, their largest reserve asset is gold. I don’t see any calls for people to divest their gold holdings. Or to stop buying gold jewelry just bc Russia owns it. Although to be clear - i don’t think that either view is unreasonable if the goal is to penalize / weaken Russia. I just find the anti-Bitcoin, gold-neutral stance weird and inconsistent. 

China will likely end up being the ones who finance much of Russia’s debt, given that they are on the verge of default and have been shut out by US / Europe. Russia as a nation has to have some currency to transact with, even if just among themselves. Ultimately the currency of choice doesn’t matter too much if they are shut out from global trade channels and the economy itself is crushed."

My burning newbie question that I desperately need help on is this, how many wallets do I need, and which ones? The whole Eth and Binance universe thing is confusing as hell and impossible to remember which coins/tokens are which, unless it’s only Ether and Bnb specifically that can’t crossover without being pegged as tokens, which I’ve never heard or read clearly explained. 

If I have Trust Wallet (which is maybe Binance but also Eth? I have Eth on it so knows?) do I also need MetaMask and 1inch and all this other stuff? 

Does every crypto person need TWO wallets minimum? One Binance and one Ethereum? 

And do you need MetaMask on TOP of all these? 
I’ve heard MetaMask is crazy unsafe and to avoid it at all costs lest I feel like losing all my coins. 

Completely lost. This guide is helpful, but since it’s predicated on Metamask I have a hard time discerning when I can use something INSTEAD of Metamask, or in addition to etc"

2021-11-25,"The OP seems to have missed that this proposal currently aims to ban earning interest on stablecoins:

*""Article 36*

*Prohibition of interest*

*Issuers of asset-referenced tokens or crypto-asset service providers shall not provide for interest or any other benefit related to the length of time during which a holder of asset-referenced tokens holds asset-referenced assets.""*

*""Article 45*

*Prohibition of interests*

*By derogation to Article 12 of Directive 2009/110/EC, no issuer of e-money tokens or crypto-asset service providers shall grant interest or any other benefit related to the length of time during which a holder of e-money tokens holds such e-money tokens.""*

This means Celsius, YouHodler, BlockFi, any other crypto lending platform, AKA  ""crypto-asset service provider"", would no longer be able to provide interest on stablecoins. As far as I understand, this is done to protect banks and their tiny or even negative interest rates. Not great."

2021-11-25,"My work mainly consists in dealing with some of the EU programs and I can say that EU and especially the European Commission are generally a bureaucratic hell.

However, reading this it seems they have managed to propose an extremely decent set of crypto regulations.

""C) Crypto-assets offered for free: no regulations"" Bearing this in mind it would seem that the main people who were writing this proposal are among us and are Moon whales."
2021-11-25,Yo! All 405 Pages!!??? I have never seen that many pages together in my life!

2021-11-25,"Excellent write up, thanks for taking the time to do so. Overall through my proximity to people working in the EU's tech/research divisions, I find the EU to be very much in favour of DLT/Blockchain and even crypto as a whole. A lot of the regulation is being pitched as ""consumer protection"" rather than as a direct response to any threat crypto poses to the monetary/financial systems here. The ECB is already working on proposing a digital euro (with privacy being the number 1 request during their public feedback period) and a lot of these regulations are a lot less strict than I would have imagined for the EU.

Will be a very interesting couple of years that's for sure. Thanks again for taking the time to parse this for those of us who can't read through 400+ pages right now. Cheers!"
2021-11-25,"The restriction on privacy coins is expected but seems like it makes Monero (and other privacy coins) that much more needed. 

Privacy/decentralization is the goal! Curious to see how/where those coins become traded or can be exchanged in the EU. I guess a VPN and foreign exchanges …but the principal of it makes me feel like /cc needs to figure out what’s more important, Profits or the principal of financial freedom / privacy / decentralization. It can be both, but I guess I’m tryna say that we need the moneros of the world, we can’t let them get squashed out by the governments / institutions and this regulatory framework is a good step forward for adoption and credibility of the space, but theoretically at the expense of one of pillars of why cryptocurrencies and cryptography based ledgers are important, *privacy*"

2021-11-25,The United States is not the only market for Crypto. Glad to see other nations trying to accomplish things properly. I hope they take time with the issue.
2021-11-25,">There is, however, a small but concerning statement for privacy coins: “The operating rules of the trading platform for crypto-assets shall prevent the admission to trading of crypto-assets which have inbuilt anonymisation function unless the holders of the crypto-assets and their transaction history can be identified by the crypto-asset service providers that are authorised for the operation of a trading platform for crypto-assets”.

2021-06-15,"tldr; Large hedge funds expect to increase their cryptocurrency holdings to 7% in five years, according to a survey conducted by the Financial Times. This comes after the increased involvement from prominent names like Stan Druckenmiller, Paul Tudor Jones III, and SkyBridge Capital. However, digital asset purchases still remain limited to clients that have a high-risk tolerance.

2021-06-15,Once the hedge funds get in more crypto gets shorted. Than we will see SEC in crypto. It's far better now.
2021-06-15,They’re not your friend pal
2021-06-15,I imagine that 100 hedge funds concluding that CFOs plan to allocate over **8%** of their portfolios to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies by 2026 would be more bullish news than your headline.
2021-06-15,Bullish? When hedge funds get involved you know your once nice coin has become nothing but a shitty greedy instrument to only make the rich richer. Crypto is pure shit and this proves it. If you can make a buck out of it good for you but the 1% you so much hated have become a part of you and you now root for them becoming richer while you gain crumbs (again) and the poor becomes poorer.
2021-06-15,That means one thing for us boys...accumulate and HODL. Next 10 years is a promising decade for those who are patient
2021-06-15,How is this bullish? Is big money in crypto not a sign of a takeover and manipulating crap out of it?
2021-06-15,im unsubscribing from this sub. seems like a bunch of angsty teens writing so much idiotic shit every day more and more. bye

2021-03-04,"I'm brand new to crypto.  I have not invested yet, but plan on doing it soon.  

I have saved about 10 posts on this sub recently.  Which I plan on reading and learning about.  The whole thing can feel very over whelming to start.   

I feel like like if I don't start to learn about this now, I will be left in the Stone age."
2021-03-04,"1/3 is generous. I'd say at least half of people don't even know what a blockchain is or what the purpose of Cryptocurrency is.

How many people have asked *""I can send money from my bank for free, why would I use cryptocurrency?""*. The entire basic premise of Cryptocurrency is to have decentralized peer to peer transfers that don't rely on middlemen to grift your money from you.

Now, this isn't hating on the new folks to the space, and it's not an elitist club, but if you're investing in something you should know at the *very least* the basics of the space and why cryptocurrency exists."
2021-03-04,I'd venture a guess of less than 10% of crypto investors understand blockchain tech.
2021-03-04,"Yeah really I notice this the last couple weeks. I was talking to a friend of mine last week, and he had just started investing in crypto. He chose Cardano as his first crypto (pretty good pick btw) because it wants to do roughly the same as Ethereum and it was only $1.40 and Ethereum is already $1600!!!

...

I explained to him that's not how it works"
2021-03-04,"Even if people knew about the tech, I think the top few coins would dominate market share.  The top few anything dominates market share in everything.  Everyone could have a degree in carbonization... Coca-Cola and Pepsi will still dominate the soft drink market.  You can totally understand combustion... the top 5 car companies will still dominate the market.

Anyways, I got into Bitcoin 100% because of the price action.  If it had the tech of Nano with smart contracts (so really great tech) but in over a decade the price had only gone from sub-penny to $0.03 *and* it still dominated the charts... I totally wouldn't be here.  That's not beating my 401k, which is what I'm in crypto for.

I read up about the tech, watched some docs about fiat currencies then watched some docs about blockchain and the history of Bitcoin.  When I invest now, I'm looking at the tech powering a coin and if I think it has potential use... but only potential use that translates into price action.  Price action is what gets me wet and I have no qualms about it.  ""You can hate me now... but I won't stop now"" - Diddy.

Helium is the only coin where I'm actually propping up the tech and I don't care about the price, I live in the hood and I want there to be IOT infrastructure and I know the city will leave us in the dust if the powers that be have their way.  I would like to run an ADA node, primarily because they're focused on getting Africa even more on the crypto train and they're public about that.  Those are like the only two though where the tech is really what gets me.  I mine ETH, RVN, and XMR 24/7 but that's only to get free shillings.  I give zero f**** about the sanctity of decentralization or doing my part to keep the network secure.  To me, that's a cool bonus.  Like it's cool.  I get the tech of it and blockchain is cool.  I've always been a nerd and into computers my whole life so I'm not anti-tech, but the price action is what I'm here for.  The tech is interesting but if all it was is tech and no price action, I'd just read about it in *Popular Science* and talk about blockchain's potential online but I wouldn't be doing DCA into it like I am now.

If you aren't running nodes or saving up to have enough to run one or whatever the equivalent is for your coin or mining purely for the sake of securing a PoW network, you're in it for the price action.  And there's nothing wrong with this.  That's the beauty of it.  Most of these things are designed to appeal to both parties (pure tech heads and pure money heads)."
2021-03-04,The reason a few coins dominate the market share is because 99.98% of crypto are shitcoins.
2021-03-04,My biggest fear for this sub is that doge and wsb bleeds into here more and more with mewns and rocket ships. Although I love my fair share of lambo memes and such. For a newbie it makes us look like jokes.

2021-03-04,It’s so overwhelming trying to keep up with new projects and updates from established coins.
2021-03-04,"When I first started investing in BTC I had no idea what crypto actually was and how it worked. Now I know some of the handles around blockchain, but my investing is still what it was when I first started: appalling.

That's the thing, though. Even if I'm losing money, I'm still excited to learn about new coins and their use cases. It's what crypto is all about and I think that magic is not lost."
2021-03-04,Unfortunately the price is the only thing most people care about.
2021-03-04,"Not to be a negative Nancy but duh. Although I have came to the conclusion it’s more like 2/3 based off my Facebook newsfeed with people I know put #XRP #DOGE #TOTHEMOON while posting screenshots from their Robinhood accounts showing the amount of doge/Xrp/whatever they have, but will edit out the amount of dollars it is worth.

Great job u/lovinglyhandmade your username checks out"
2021-02-16,"Surely an interesting website, good job!

I think having people to be able to insert a specific amount (keyboard) would be useful as well. Sliding to a specific amount could sometimes be a bit annoying compared to simply being able to put the amount in ourselves (you know, autism).

Looking towards a more attractive UI, maybe adding basic things in like the top 5 coins % swing in a horizontal ray at the top or things like that could be interesting.

Something else (that will require a bit more work) is directly linking to the foundation/company website behind the project.

Anyways, great work!"

\-Nano

\-Elrond

\- Dash is 80% from ATH. If it cracks the top 10, thats a 6x from its current price.

\- Nano is 80% from ATH and if it cracks top 25, thats a 3x from its current price.

\- Both these are as conservative as you can be in a bull run."
2021-02-16,"This must be a sign to buy NANO, I was just looking at it a few hours ago haha. Thanks for building this!"
2021-02-16,"Great, thanks, now hopefully people will be more realistic with their predictions on this sub. I saw $10k ADA being floated in the daily the other day"
2021-02-16,ok complete idiot here but when I look at LINK and Cardano doesn't it basically say they are bad picks because they already exceeded their value? I am only saying this because clearly it will never achieve same market cap at BTC and ETH??  Please PLEASE tell me I am absolutely wrong...
2021-02-16,"I would say the warning you put for Monero is useless.  The important part about a particular cryptocurrency's supply, is the the rate at which new units are generated.

For the next couple decades, Monero will have a lower emission rate than bitcoin.

What would be better is to state if the cryptocurrency has a known rate.  i.e. can it be inflated at any time?"

They are tracking all data and even social media and running AI based analysis on individual behavior. After a while when they are confident they can make the final move, they will create a final peak. The prices will get insanely high. Huge marketing efforts will be made to assure the general public the bull market is here to stay for a long time. And then they will dump, confident that people are fully complacent. Prices will fall, but not enough to create a panic. By the time the panic is created and volumes start dropping ""they"" will have made their exits with profits not seen in the history of mankind.

I know having some time in any space makes one more intolerant of n00b mistakes, but by god folks, if mass adoption is what we are crossing our fingers for--at least pretend to give a shit. Seeing the ""they deserve what they got"" sentiment just stinks so bad especially coming off of the whole Ice Poseidon/Coffeezilla phone interview where HE SAYS THE EXACT SAME THING about his fans that bought into the shitcoin he shilled and eventually rugged.

2021-04-23,Bought Dec 2017. I'm built for this.
2021-04-23,"From a trader and a Hodler, here is my perspective:

This correction is good no matter how you shake it. Nothing but green, as good as it feels, is unhealthy for a market. Fact is we are already <200+ days from testing the 20 week moving average, that is too long. Systemic corrections down to the 20w and then bouncing off is what makes for a prolonged bull market.

As a Hodler, a correction to the 20w MA and up gives the bull market longevity and length. As a trader it provides a great buying position to advance into the current ATHs (~100% gains on ADA and UNI and a 73% on ETH. 

With that being said we got two scenarios:

Bearish scenario: we went too long without a 20wMA test and the 20w MA isn't strong enough so we fall back down to the fair value for another reaccmulation phase until the next bull market in 2022-2023.

Bullish scenario: we hold on the 20w MA, glide along that for 1 or 2 months and then we pop up and start to push much higher ATHs (like the 2013 market).

Can't advise you what to do, nor should you take advice from a random on the internet (research and draw your own conclusions) but I will be trading with the Bullish scenario instead of the bearish.

Best of luck to everyone"

2022-03-30,"How though, they do not also take into account other things like the production of the equipment and facilities to refine and mine the gold?


When comparing Bitcoin to Gold 

Gold mined = 3000 tonnes/year divided by 365 = 8.2 tonnes/day

Energy Cost = 25 kWh of electricity per gram/gram of gold = 90,000 KJ
1 million grams in a tonne

8.2 million grams/day mined of gold

90k KJ x 8,200,000 = 738,000,000,000 KJ/day used mining gold

Bitcoin 110 Terawatt Hours per year = 110,000,000,000 kWh/year / 365 = 301,369,863 kWh/year

Bitcoin mining uses ~301 MILLION kWh / day

Gold mining uses ~205 MILLION kWh / day

Bitcoin can also use types of energy that these other industries cannot without dumping tons of toxic waste per day. Maybe it's time we look at improving or reducing the types of mining that have an insanely larger footprint on the planet.

Mining Bitcoin when comparing only Gold Refinement Energy (keep in mind not energy for the actual facilities and maintenance) uses ~32% more energy than mining gold. However 50% of mined gold is used for jewelry and less than ~10% is used for things that are necessary in everyday life and provides a benefit to society like electronics. Most of it is stored in underground reserves and hidden reserves.

There are 26 tons of waste produced for every gold ring. Thousands of tons of cyanide, mercury, arsenic, diesel, and oil is used every day. The largest mining company (Barrick) uses over 50 million pounds of tires every year. That is over 6 thousand 11.5 foot tall 8,500 pound bridgestone tires, just for mining trucks. It takes 50+ barrels of oil to make one of these large tires, this does not include the steel, other materials, the electricity and labor used in their production. And takes 10 thousand man hours to produce that one barrel of oil.
I believe if we calculated these energy costs as well, this number would dwarf Bitcoin by a substantial margin."

2022-03-30,"This study appears to ignore many upfront-cost elements to mining gold that aren’t an issue with Bitcoin mining. A bigger issue is that the term “mining” is only relevant here in an analogical manner. Comparing these two practices (mining and crypto mining) is comparing significantly different models of expense/risk/profit. 

It’s probably unproductive to compare these disparate forms of “mining,” which are only analogically similar. You have to draw lines at which costs are related to “mining” for both industries, which means any comparison is also fraught with inconsistencies as to what fits in those respective categories.

Crypto mining and traditional mining are, if anything, parallel/adjacent industries that can work in tandem for mutual benefit. We see this a lot in the energy sector, where companies are moving into utilizing excess energy/burn-off, etc. to power crypto miners. 

That being said, I just think that comparing the mining of gold to mining bitcoin is not that productive or interesting of a problem/question. A more interesting area of interest would be to ask how (if at all) gold mining operations might leverage crypto mining and/or blockchain technology in their operations to maximize profit/mitigate forms of risk."

It's genuinely funny that the story is not people more than double their money buying Trump nft's, instead it's floor drops 70%.

Edit: Lots of folk upset I said money laundering, I adjusted it to tax evasion.  They send their alt scamming account coins and declare it as a loss against their known account to pay less taxes.   Then the scam account funnels the money through Monero or to a banking entity with 0 reporting."

2021-10-14,"Reposting my comment from another thread on my thoughts:

Initially this news seems bullish, it's yet another country that seems to be embracing crypto. Russia is one of the world's largest markets, and one of the world's largest internet user bases at 85% internet penetration, meaning that its population seems ripe for crypto growth.

However, in the wider geopolitical context, one could view this as an attempt by Putin to weaken the power of US economic sanctions. Also from the Bloomberg article:

> Russia has sought alternatives to trading in dollars since being slapped with sanctions in 2014 following the annexation of Crimea, and Putin accuses the U.S. of using its currency as a weapon.

Russia wouldn't be the only country under the threat of US sanctions that have used Crypto to lessen the impact of US economic sanctions. Iran is known to use Bitcoin mining as a way to generate revenue despite sanctions and even incentivized miners to setup operations in Iran by providing cheap electricity (Reuters). North Korea also uses crypto to evade sanctions, and an Ethereum Foundation researcher was even arrested in 2019 for allegedly helping North Korea deploy blockchain technology (Business Insider).

From the US's perspective, wider crypto adoption runs the risk of undermining US economic leverage and removing the ability to use sanctions as a credible threat. If you think about it, future is even inherent in crypto's narrative as sounder, more salable money. It seems likely that the US will look for ways to weakening crypto's ability to be used for sanctions evasion."

2021-06-11,I just applied this week for a mortage backed with my crypto holdings. Im in Canada and I have a mortage broker. I should know on monday what banks are thinking about it.
2021-06-11,"I just did this with a mortgage and they asked for all these statements as well. I have more than the value of the underlying house in stock. They still wanted me to put 40% down because my student loans + the mortgage payment was going to be over 50% of the income from my job otherwise. 

When I asked about the fact that I have something like 150% of the value of the house in stock/options/crypto they said they don't lend against assets like that. They can only use capital gains if there's at least a 2-year history (2019 wasn't good for me).

I talked to several lenders and they all said the same thing. How exactly are they counting your coinbase account in your favor? Mortgage lending is pretty standardized. There's not a lot of leeway for lenders to play by their own rules if they want to offload the mortgage to Fannie Mae or Freddie mac or whoever later (which your local credit union is very likely to do).

Honestly lending against crypto (even at 70%) seems pretty crazy for a legacy financial institution when most major cryptocurrencies have dropped 50% or more in the last month."
2021-06-11,"Mortgage loan officer here. They don’t care about the value of it because you preapprove without it, guaranteed. They just need to verify anything stated on the application. If the AUS was asking for verified reserves to justify the loan total there is no way in hell they would use those."
2021-06-11,For pre approval. Or for the actual loan?
2021-06-11,state? country?
2021-06-11,How tf do you provide 3 months of “statements?” Also mind you my crypto is not kept inside of exchanges.
2021-06-11,Do you believe that they took the crypto as part of your value or as something they can take if you default?
2021-06-11,"I mean your credit union would accept the value of anything that you own of value.  If I listed the guitars I own, they would consider that as well."
2021-06-11,"Oh yeah wait til I show up at my bank with 14,000,000,000 shib they will walk me straight to the vault with security to deposit my hand written keys"
2021-06-11,Maybe your credit union just didn't care in general? Crypto is highly volatile and can sway much more than 30%. Not only that but you can't even be verified as the owner. It's high risk. Your income and credit score probably pulled most of the weight.
2021-06-11,Oh nice! Good to know. May I ask which country you live in? I'm in Canada and looking to buy a home soon. This will definitely help my husband and I out.

It's too scary, dRuggs and crIm3...it's definitely a scam!

 They literally have no idea how crypto works. They have ""people"" that work hard to help them try to understand but they fail miserably on a regular basis. Being a boomer myself, I know many businessmen that I have tried, but nevertheless cannot help them get a clear picture of the basics. I've tried to help some of my friends share the fully realized 80% gains that I have enjoyed in one freakin year. I can show them on paper. They are baffled. They refuse to engage in committing to learning how these new processes and financial tools work. 

Strangely, DeFi for instance, and many of the new financial instruments being applied to crypto, are taken straight from the interest generating, derivative producing, and capital creation systems developed by the big banks and trading markets.

 It's fucking genius IMO that Satoshi et al envisioned this. This is the best science fiction/fact moment in my life by far. But it's very much like a foreign language, that a huge swath of old school finance guys just can't seem to wrap their heads around.

For a laugh, if you know an accountant, ask them about your tax implications for your yield farming investments, and the automated token swapping networks you've been using, and the ETH liquidity markets you're all in with. Ha!

IMO, we're still in the early adoption phase as far as I'm concerned, and there's nothing but opportunity ahead for all of us. \*cough\*BUY NOW\*cough\*

Look, I am pro-crypto and anti-bank like most people here.

And it's only getting worse every day.

Instead of pretending the issue somehow doesn't exist, we should focus on fixing the issue by, for example, moving away from PoW towards the vast array of alternate consensus algorithms that aren't power-hungry.

2021-05-05,I still think projects to reduce the energy consumption are pivotal. It’s not a question of less of two evil but rather which one will move forward faster.
2021-05-05,"Visa requires 149 kilowatt hours for 100,000 transactions. Bitcoin requires **741 kilowatt hours** for **ONE** transaction. A bitcoin transaction requires 74 million times more energy than a Visa transaction.

Most kettles use about 2kw. You'd have to boil your kettle constantly for 370 hours (15 days) to waste the same amount of energy as one bitcoin transaction.

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/881541/bitcoin-energy-consumption-transaction-comparison-visa/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/881541/bitcoin-energy-consumption-transaction-comparison-visa/)

PoW mining's impact is extremely, extremely high relative to the value it currently brings to the world.

The key here is that PoW mining is wasteful by design, and is unnecessary. The first rule of reducing waste is to *prevent* it by rethinking/redesigning. Reducing or improving supply chain impacts comes below that (e.g. using renewables; it's better, but not as good as removing some of the energy wastage). This is one aspect of why Proof of Stake, which redesigns decentralized network validation to be hundreds of times less wasteful, is so important.

Also, none of the rules for reducing environmental impacts are whataboutism and deflection of legitimate problems via pointing the finger at other problems."

You throw $200 in BTC, it drops $10k, Yea that's Def a hit if you have to sell then and there, but I don't think anybody realistically thinks Bitcoin is going anywhere close to 0... Not FAST by any means...

But Satoshi Nakamoto isn't on Twitter pumping BTC, trying to gain a fan base, attempting to get those followers to get you *verified on Twitter*, making promises on promises on promises.... No he made it, and it exists...

But many people in this cryptosphere have no morals, and many of these teams behind these coins are incredibly manipulative and try to create an echo chamber among their holders.. Any criticism or questions are FUD, everybody is reinforcing each other, but the Devs are in a back room laughing and rolling in FIAT currency they're raking in from ""*these gullible IDIOTS HAHAHA*"" 

I don't know if they have malicious intent, or are just incompetent Devs, but either way it doesn't matter... Either way, they GOT the money, and the project is NOT going according to their road map AT ALL.

2022-01-01,"When using wallets for the first time, send a small transactions first before a much larger amount."
2022-01-01,"If you are in DeFi, tools like zapper or debank are fantastic at tracking and managing your positions across multiple platforms and chains. Apy.vision tracks your yield, impermanent loss and provides historical vault analytics if you are interested in yield farming. If farming, compounding tools like Beefy.finance are essential for automating and vetting safe products. Some auto compounders offer degen vaults, but beefy does full security audits of the underlying platforms, so you can be a little bit more confident about some risks. 

My only other DeFi advice is 1. be very conservative if using lending platforms to build leverage and 2. that in my experience, it’s always better to be earning 20% apy on a token that’s about to multiply in value, than chasing +500% apy on a coin that will loose 4/5ths of its value. A million% of 0 is still 0. Also expect those 3-4 digit APYs to last weeks if not days. New opportunities have huge numbers when they launch, so it only takes a few days to saturate with funds and the numbers come back to earth. I joined the CRO-BTC pool on vvs 2 weeks ago earning 110%, it’s already down to 90% and I expect 40% by month end, 10% in 5 months, ect, ect. 

Last year I played with a degen farm (so you don’t have to) offering 54,000% apy and after a few weeks of earning, the token had inflated enough that my position was worth 10% less even though I had so much more of it. It’s just not worth it, big number attract big idiot."

2022-01-13,"Thanks for posting this. I've come across it a few times and I'm doing an experiment of my own that I just started a few weeks back. I have currently just been posting a table of current standings in mine, but want to incorporate more graphs and tracking statistics like you're doing and will use this as a model. This type of post is among my favorite in the sub because it illustrates a number of things and helps us come to some conclusions.

One uncomfortable truth that your experiment clearly points out is that we really don't know what might happen over the next 5 years in the crypto space and it's very possible that many of the projects we fully believe in now will be gone or at least in really rough shape 5 years from now.

It's easy to get caught up in the idea that a rising tide lifts all boats, but this experiment shows that not all boats are seaworthy.

Thanks!"

BCH is a fork of btc. Different ideas, different point of views. I know about the war on reddit that occurred years ago, but the reddit community doesn't represent every investor of bch"
2021-11-10,To be fair it is ETH that is a result of the hack and not ETC.  Technically ETC is the original chain where the stolen funds were not reallocated.

While i kinda see where the sceptics towards eth classic comes from, I think of bitcoin cash as legit.

While eth classic is a result of a hack, bch is the result of a part of the community not being cool with block sizes. It is kind of the basic idea behind btc to be open source, hence I can not see where the bashing is coming from.

Outside of living comfortable even if I have to work I just want to be able to travel the world because at 30 Ive never left the state or done anything but play video games and work to look after my son.

2021-04-03,"That is what keeps the machine going. The carrot on the stick. And the problem is much broader than crypto. Everyone is struggling to get his head above water with passive income being the golden carrot. But the truth is, there can only be a few with passiv income and there need to be many that pay that passiv income. 

And the problem is a power imbalance and until the many don't step up and take power from the few nothing will change. Now p2p money that cannot be printed by the powerful could be one of the steps to that utopia, where everyone can earn enough and the Unsatisfyable are not able to gather passive income from millions."

2021-04-03,Please don't invest more than you can lose people.
2021-04-03,If you don’t understand the technology you are less likely to make good investment decisions.
2021-04-03,"(This might come off as rude. This is not my intention.)

You won't have *much* luck lifting yourself out of poverty with investing in crypto. If you invested $500 in Bitcoin back in August 2020, you would now have $2500. Maybe it will be 500k/BTC in the near future. Then your $500 from August 2020 would be \~$25000. Maybe not. No guarantee.

If you would have invested back in 2007, the thing would look different - of course. But did you? Neither did I. I just did not have the capabilities back then. And I would have probably sold my BTC at $1000/BTC and frown today.

What I'm getting at - if you do not have a lot of money, a 2000% increase won't bring you even half-a-million. It might eliminate your debt, which would be great, but will not grant you the ability to never have to work again.

Desperation is dangerous, you might risk even the last life savings you have and loose everything to scams like Bitconnect."
2021-04-03,"this is exactly what my situation was.  poverty sucks dicks.  over 50% of my income was going straight to my landlord, and it still hurts my insides to think about it.  i had family in the same town with open bedrooms... they just didn't want me there.  good times.  i was delivering pizza for dominos throughout my 20s and hail-mary'd my (sadly very small) life savings into ether at 42$ in 2017.  i've sold most of that and am currently building a tinyhouse with my bare hands.  gonna cost me ~35k but i'm free from rent forever.  that's +10-15k/year in my pocket compared to the last 15 years of rentals.  with the 5% or so of that, that i still have in eth, i'll prolly hodl until i absolutely need it to survive."

2021-04-03,"Considering you're guaranteed to lose 50% or more of the value in your current holdings once we enter the bear market you sure as shit should be investing with money you can 100% lose.

If you're in this market throwing money into it while being in poverty and expecting appreciating returns then you're going to be in for a very rude awakening.

The only appreciating returns in this market is when you buy at bear market bottoms and even then each cycle culls projects that didn't make it and this cycle is bound to be the same.

Just look back at the 2013 run, most of the ""winners"" are no longer even a thing and same goes for 2017, there are very few long-term ""good"" projects that will last and just like the dotcom bubble in order to hold these when all is set and done you either need to be extremely lucky OR have an education in I.T and understand the tech.

We're in a speculative run, not the mature/adoption run that people have been waiting for since 2013 and 2017, this cycle is no where near that point and we're nearing the end of it."
2021-04-03,"Not trying to get out of poverty, just trying to avoid it when the currency apocalypse begins. As everyone moves towards a more virtual world crypto will be king, the only question is which one will dominate the new virtual world and my personal bet is on ETH as it is the base for most blockchain games and other projects."
2021-04-03,"Well, I didn’t wait to invest in crypto to tell my managers to fuck off. But I hope crypto will allow me to quit my job and not have to tell them anymore.

I’m not in for the tech and to be fair I don’t fully understand every project, however I wouldn’t put my money in a coin if I don’t think the tech they’re offering is interesting. 

If I ever make life changing money with crypto, I’d build a business, leave my tiny apartment and buy a house in a quiet place.

Best luck to all investors in here 🍀"

Like, if I find a video no one claimed as NFT, can I tie it to the blockchain and sell it?

If I make a bunch of pixel art, like... 100 of them, and then tie them to NFTs (somehow?) for sale... does it appear as a group of 100 individual items (like a catalogue) on some exchange somewhere?

Do I have to do it through a website, or is there a way to do it on my own? 

Do I need to own actual ETH in my wallet to link code to it? Is there a fee?

How are NFTs tied to the blockchain? Like, if it's not tied 1 to 1 with ETH, (say it's worth 0.1 ETH), how is it stored? How do you sell ownership of 0.1 ETH vs 1.0 ETH?

I have so many questions, and the internet/Google does not help, and I work 10hrs/day and take care of twins for 5 hours/night and go to sleep... day after day... with time to browse Reddit, but no time to actually *research* something.

To be fair to a lot of our Crypto investors, for them it's their first experience in a speculative market. I can tell you from experence, the first five, maybe ten years of doing this, will turn you into an OCD nightmare. But then one day, you'll wake up and realize you haven't checked the market for three days. At that point you'll have to set reminders for a quick glance on the weekends. 

The only thing I can encourage you to do (as an old trader myself) is to not let this become or define your life.

2021-06-08,">In any event, an FBI official just told reporters that it doesn’t matter where the Bitcoin wallet is—the FBI still can get access. They won’t say how.

😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣😂 Don't make me laugh so hard!"
2021-06-08,"The FBI did NOT hack Bitcoin.  
They simply subpoena servers that the hackers operated for their operations, and which contained the private key for their Bitcoin wallet, allowing FBI to access the funds in these wallet and to transfer them to FBI controlled wallet."
2021-06-08,"If you're scared they can access your wallet, wait until you find out how bank accounts work."
2021-06-08,#ALL YOUR KEYS ARE NOW BELONG TO US!
2021-06-08,"I did a back-of-envelope calculation that showed that it would be faster to mine all the remaining bitcoins 6 billion times than it would to crack a single private key using brute force.

If the FBI found a way to efficiently crack a private key, that would mean they solved the most important math problem humanity has ever faced, that P=NP (in the affirmative). What they could do would go far beyond breaking all of the Internet's security protocols (which they could do). They would be able to solve all the mathematical theorems that humanity has ever worked on for thousands of years, plus many new ones we never thought about, in a matter of days or hours. They would be able to efficiently create superhuman AI using modest computational resources.

Hell, if the FBI found P=NP, we should probably all be ecstatic, because it means we would probably all solve the problem of digital immortality, and start moving towards being an intergalactic civilization within a matter of years. But that's also probably why P =/= NP. And I find it laughable that people are panicking about their bitcoin because they think that the FBI solved P=NP.

EDIT:All right, so I may have been a little careless in posting this, and some things here are either wrong or just exaggerated. I was just venting, and not really putting much time or effort in the post, because, honestly, I didn't think this post would get more than 2 upvotes. I'm surprised it did get so many upvotes, considering it was kind of half-assed and not the best quality post. But since it did, let me just correct a few things:

\-factorization is not known to be NP-complete, so it's not true that, to crack a private key efficiently, you would *have* to have found an algorithm that solves NP-complete problems in polynomial time. While we know of no *classical* algorithm that factorizes in polynomial time (Shor's algorithm does so, but it's a quantum algorithm), that doesn't mean there isn't one. (Although I would maintain the idea that it's ridiculous to think that, of all organizations, the FBI would be the ones to find one if it exists.)

\-it's not necessarily true that factoring in polynomial time is the *only* way the FBI could have cracked a private key. But we damn well better hope it's true, because the other way is that there's a security hole in the protocol of Bitcoin that doesn't exist in most other cryptographic security protocols. But I maintain that this is extremely unlikely, and the most likely way they found it is by some means that has nothing to do with bitcoin security (e.g. phishing it, legally coercing a public exchange to give the key up, getting remote access to their devices where they wrote it down, setting up a honeypot wallet and tricking the hackers, busting into their place and ""asking them nicely"", etc.)

\-My whole post assumed that ""discovering P=NP"" is equivalent to ""having an algorithm that solves an NP-complete problem in polynomial time"", but that's not *strictly* true. While we suspect that, if P=NP, that's *probably* the way we would prove it, it's not technically the only possible way to prove it.

\-I definitely exaggerated what you could do with a polynomial-time algorithm for solving NP-complete problems. You couldn't solve *all* the theorems, just the ones that are verifiable in polynomial time. And the point about ""digital immortality"" was just purely speculative

\-a lot of problems in machine learning are NP-hard, which is not the same thing as NP-complete. That is to say, if you do find a polynomial algorithm for NP-complete problems, that doesn't necessarily mean you can necessarily solve any NP-hard problem, which most ML problems are. So while I do think that having an polynomial algorithm for NP-complete problems would bring huge strides to the AI community, I guess I don't know for sure that it would help solve a lot of those problems much faster.

\-my ""back-of-the-envelope"" calculation doesn't account for the periodic halving of bitcoin rewards, nor the fact that the hash target for mining changes according to the rate at which it was recently mined. I was just assuming the current reward rate and hashing target. It would have been more accurate to say ""given the current reward rate and hashing target, it would be about as fast to mine 10\^13 bitcoins as it would be to crack a single private key using brute force"". The idea of this point isn't to say what you can physically do in real life, I simply meant to give an order-of-magnitude intuition of how hard it would be to crack a private key with respect to mining bitcoin, using pure brute force."
2021-06-08,The FBI never lies. Same with the CIA.
2021-06-08,I already thought it was odd that the hackers wouldn’t request monero. But then to a Coinbase acct? It seems like the btc was meant to be found. And they only recovered a little more than half of it. Sounds like some hackers already got paid to me.
2021-06-08,Mainstream Media in the USA is one of the biggest perpetrators of intentional disinformation campaigns and narrative pushing this world has ever seen.
2021-06-08,"The entire world community of advanced mathematicians and cryptography experts have been over sha2 with a fine tooth comb, and I doubt the US Government is more competent than the rest of the world combined. Or at all, most of the time. If any flaw or vulnerability were found it would not be the end for Bitcoin, as Bitcoin can just change alogorithms with a hard fork, but the rest of the internet may well be screwed. Centralized authorities are not as nimble. In any case, reversing the hash from the public would be impossible. They'd need to crack the wallet directly, even if that were possible. If my wallet is stored in my head as a 12 word seed phrase, they only get access if I give it to them."
2021-06-08,The FBI shot Martin Luther King
2021-06-08,So do we think I can get a job at the FBI so I can recover my lost Bitcoin and that of the others like me?
2021-06-08,I've got a wallet that I can't get into... help me u/FBI you're my only hope!
2021-06-08,"Sounds like a sale coming up! What BS journalism lol And even if this was true, bank accounts are so much saver right ?"
2021-06-08,Both organizations are in the misinformation buisness. Thats what they do to keep us in line.
2021-06-08,Can we have just one fucking day without FUD…just one. It’s exhausting.
2021-06-08,"If they obtained improperly stored private keys on a server and they were seized/hacked they are right, the physical location of whatever device the wallet is stored on doesn't matter. That does not mean the FBI can gain access to any wallet without keys though. As many know, you shouldn't expose your private keys to the internet"
2021-06-08,This reminds me of the movies where hackers type furiously for ten seconds on a keyboard and break in to the most complex database.
2021-06-08,A friendly reminder that you need exactly zero technical qualifications to become a reporter. All you need to do is create a headline that you think people will click on and then give vague details about the event. Most modern journalists rival telemarketers when evaluating their usefulness to society.

2021-06-08,"The media doesn't understand cryptocurrency at all so it's not surprising that they are parroting bullshit that's being spoonfed to them from the feds. Sadly, they do this on a lot of topics and it's partly why america overall is so damn ignorant and misinformed on numerous issues. If journalists were still worth their salt they'd research crypto, get even a small bit of passing knowledge on it so they can ask decent follow-up questions or simply offer their findings in the report to counter what the FBI is saying. But research don't get clicks and everybody in 'news' wants to be first even if it's first to look stupid."
2021-02-02,"The doge hype brought me here. I asked how to buy it, and several people in this community redirected me. I'm now a proud owner of ether and bitcoin. Thanks my new peoples!"
2021-02-02,"I’m a complete crypto noob. The first crypto I ever bought was doge last week. Immediately realized I had no idea what doge was so I researched it and moved it in time. 

This community helped me there and I noticed right away how good the old guard is here. So hopefully things can remain awesome."
2021-02-02,"It is a good lesson. There are a lot of inpatient people believing to get rich fast, sometimes its good to lose some money and to learn from your mistakes."
2021-02-02,"I'm particularly concerned for the Doge subreddit itself.

I always understood it was a fun community to promote the usage of crypto. Currently, it's behaving like a PnD group and the mods don't seem to delete the related posts."
2021-02-02,"I feel the same way. I guess we just have to keep putting good info out there and talking to the new investors. A lot of new people are gonna be getting on board in the coming months.

That being said, some folks just have to learn the hard way. I got burned when I first started and that turned out to be my tuition cost."
2021-02-02,"Unfortunately this is just all part of a new, mainly unregulated market. The mods here do a great job of cleaning up what they can but at the end of the day people can’t be hand held all the time. 

Hopefully those burnt by recent events have learnt their lessons and didn’t ‘invest’ more than they could afford to lose. 

Long term, this won’t have a negative effect on the community or cryptocurrency as a whole, pump and dump schemes have been around longer than crypto after all."
2021-02-02,"All we users can do is be active in trying to warn people. And it is truly worth it to do so, our words of warnings might quite literally save some lives in the long run."
2021-02-02,"I think the best help would be fighting fire with fire. The whole Doge thing is a meme, and a ""counter-meme"" that could reach front page would help a lot of people to see and to seek the different and more accurate perspectives."
2021-02-02,"I don't know if anyone noticed but this whole madness started when Justin Sun manipulated the WSB sub into thinking he is on their side. Of course they couldn't know that he is a dick.

Hours later, he literally promotes a pump and dump group [on his twitter page](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1355203959405768706) . He even tweeted [a screenshot](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1355201129278099457) that clearly shows a Telegram group pumping TRX.


All of this lead to a price surge in Tanzanian Gold Corp stocks because their ticker is TRX.


If you want to blame anyone blame the guy that owns all the bots. I have no idea how he can promote a P&D publicly and not a single crypto ""media outlet"" covered the story."
2021-02-02,IMO crypto subs should limit posts and comments to karma above some values to avoid manipulation
2021-02-02,"I don’t usually talk much about crypto at work. I’ll mention it time to time, but I don’t really try to push it on anyone. Last week though was a damn nightmare listening to people talking about “buying shares of DOGE” and calling it a penny stock.

Crypto was already a “dirty” word to most people my age (I’m 40) and these latest pump and dumps are probably going to reinforce that sentiment with my age group at least."
2021-02-02,"Honestly, there's plenty of info here, regarding Doge, XRP, pumps and dumps. People have been warned constantly in the last weeks and tbh, they've been always warned, so it's their fault if they want to go all in into a coin when they barely know anything about crypto.  
There's a superb influx of new members, which will make this harder but as a community we can still thrive. We need to make an effort in order to make the good posts get to the ""HOT"" section, so that the newbies start learning a bit more about crypto, how it works, how the scams work, what are the pumps and dumps and so on.  


If we don't help them, things will be worse in the future. We also need the newbies to do their ""homework"", otherwise they will always fall into these traps. There's no such thing as free money or get rich by night schemes."
2021-02-02,"As a longtime holder of Dogecoin, basically as a “whatever let’s see” coin, this last weeks pump and dump is still a success story for me. While I watched a whole bunch of people buy in, then sell at almost a dime and plummet the situation. I still saw the overall value of Doge go up 200% and hold. Time will tell, obviously there are better cryptos, this is just something I always put my leftover change into when trading other stocks..."
2021-02-02,"I came here out of sheer desperation. COVID crippled my finances to a level I was not thinking rationally. Took my last savings... (not joking) begged people in stock groups what to do. Was not heard. Missed the GME boat. Was more desperate because I felt I not only am going to be homeless but I might also be loosing a grasp on logic and education. I couldn't believe I missed that stock. 

Then I came here for a hail marry. The verbal abuse from other groups made me not post. I lurked. I read. I cried. I put in a little and waited. I got back a bit.

If that pump and dump hit me full. I won't lie to you. I won't. I wouldn't be alive. That would have been it.

This what people don't realize. Maybe before the hustle would be no big deal... you should have know better. But now and these days everyone is desperate. The COVID component is just... scary. I mean the effects of what COVID is doing to people OUTSIDE of direct infection.

2021-02-02,I've been doing my part trying to warn people away from these kind of things. I've gotten no positive response. So either I'm warning someone part of the pump and dump or the person just sees dollar signs and I'm incorrect. Don't know what else I can do.

2021-05-30,"Why would they exchange Bolivares to USD if not to seek out a currency that won’t lose 50% purchasing power every 3 months (aka prices in Bolivares doubling every 3 months)? Isn’t that literally the definition of seeking a *store of value*?

And currency, or money, is defined as being a store of value as well. At least per wiki on what is money"

2021-12-25,"Doge has been around since 2013, a lifetime in crypto years. It’s a meme coin without an official use but it has consistently gone up with the market"
2021-12-25,"True for any project that has no use-case...

For projects that have use-case, that's just a period where chasers visit.

Fomo-buyers that hype ETH do not take away from the base of ETH-Holders that believe in the project.

Some people just refuse to accept that different investors get into projects for different reasons. The existence of meme-fomo-chasers isn't proving that a project will fail, the lack of all other types of investors is. 

Big pump can give a coin publicity, but if it has nothing to stick to it, it's going to be a one-hit-wonder... If it does have a use and value, that's a chance to stay on top.

But anyone who thinks a project that has been hyped once must die because of hype, is missing out on a whole lot of good projects... Just like those that chase ""the next hype"" will buy into a whole lot of crappy ones."
2021-12-25,I heard on a podcast the developers of DOGE were actually doing a lot of work to revitalize the coin. Is this still true?
2021-12-25,Time will tell and if you think you know of the next SHIB or DOGE don’t be shy to predict. I’m quite fond of 10X-100X increases in value
2021-12-25,Times this was said about Dogecoin in the last 8 years: a gaziolion times. These posts age like milk
2021-12-25,It’s after posts like these that meme coins tend to show you how wrong you are and then proceed to prove once against that NOBODY knows what the fuck they are talking about here.
2021-12-25,"You make a good, sensible argument, but I think perhaps you are making the mistake of assuming meme coin investors are entirely rational beings.  Humans in general are not entirely rational beings, meme coin investors are no different.

I say this as someone who considers himself generally rational.  Recently I started investing in a dog coin - Akita Inu ASA (on Algorand) - rationally, as you describe in your post.  I saw the low market cap and rationally figured that every big blockchain is bound to have a successful dog coin, therefore I might as well get in on the action...  All very rational so far...

But then I discovered the emotional aspect of meme coin investing.  There is a sense of community, cameraderie, a sense of belonging.  I had no idea about this beforehand, until I was immersed in it.  To a rational person this may sound silly, but this is how us humans operate - we are driven very much by emotion, even though we don't always like to admit it.

You could see this as the use case of meme coins: giving people that sense of community.  So long as that exists, people will continue to be attracted to meme coins big and small.

There's also the fact that many investors *still* don't know the difference between token value and market cap.  Large-market-cap projects with low token value will continue to attract investors who think they are being rational (""it costs a fraction of a cent, imagine when it gets to a dollar!""), when really they are missing something quite fundamental.

So for these reasons I think the big meme coins like Doge and Shiba Inu will continue to attract new investors, and they may well reach and surpass their all-time highs.  Lower-market-cap meme coins are the more rational choice in many regards (though of course we do have to remember that many will go nowhere so the risk is higher in a way), but the big ones have big communities and so people are more likely to be exposed to them first.

Quoting the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing: ""It's better to be first than it is to be better!"""
2021-12-25,Doge is older than Ethereum. It has stood the test of time.
2021-12-25,"The only coin with a meme on it is dogecoin, it has been around for 8 years. It was created as a joke  to mock how 99.99% of all crypto in fact have no real utility as currency and toxic tribal communities considering their project to be the answer to all the problems in the name of making money. As a result it was created and developed simply enough to be a cryptoCURRENCY. There is no next doge because all these copytokens was created out of hype and greed, only because elon shows support for doge, have no real utility, and like you said the hype chasers will keep going on to the next hype.

2021-05-29,Why stop at 3-4?
2021-05-29,What a dumb post
2021-05-29,"The penalties on early withdrawal from retirement accounts are there to balance out the tax-deferred status; without the penalties, people would just use them as a tax-advantaged brokerage account and not actually use it for retirement. The point of the early withdrawal penalties is NOT to keep everyone artificially locked in so asset prices stay up.

By your logic, all the asset prices should be crashing because people can empty out their regular trading accounts at will, and just not contribute to 401(k) plans, so that there is only selling pressure from the retirees as they withdraw. 

Title seemed to make sense, but then the text was way out in the weeds."
2021-05-29,You know that 401k holdings get rebalanced right?  There are no tax consequence to it either.
2021-05-29,You're a fool if you are comparing a 401k to Bitcoin.
2021-05-29,"The ""penalties"" are because the money placed in your 401k is pretax. That is the reason for the penalty not to trick you into holding."
2021-05-29,">You also only have to buy into BTC once, unlike a 401K where most people keep buying back in every pay check only to lose what you earned in interest by paying a penalty if you withdraw too early. Because that's the trick. The trick to a 401K is to get everyone to hold because if everyone sells, then everyone else who didn't sell fast enough will lose money and the whole thing will crash. That's why they charge penalities.

That's not why at all.

The reason there's a penalty is because the state subsidizes 401ks by giving tax breaks to both the employer and employee, so it can reduce the burden on the state of having to look after old people who aren't working any more. 

The penalty for cashing out your 401K means having to pay taxes on it, as a disincentive for people to blow all their retirement money and then just rely on the state to look after them, which is the entire point of the scheme.

You're more than free to save for your retirement privately and blow all of it with no penalty, you just won't get any tax breaks."

2021-05-02,"As someone who's close to his 40s, with a high-paying job, I can give you only one piece of advice - if you have lots of money, make something with it to generate more money. Create a business, invest in some appreciating assets - work for yourself in general. Working a 9-5 job will not make you rich (unless you're in high management of a high-profit company). Education is important but isn't a prerequisite for getting wealthy."
2021-05-02,"Older people with jobs do not understand what it is like for young ones just getting out of school now.
You thought 2008 was bad? Sure, I remember people losing everything and having to travel to another state to work for scraps. But you could still buy land or house with enough savings and loan. Unemployment was through the roof but you could still recover. I was a student back then and I actually paid off a good chunk of my loan on desperate investment choice into XAU using the remainder of my loan. I was able to get a decent work after and pay it all off quickly.

Now we are looking at youths graduating and not being able to: afford a house in major cities where they can find work in the field they trained in, I mean, how can you buy a 3 million dollar 2 bedroom apartment when you are earning 40k a year? You will be so heavily in debt.

Many youths are turning to social media and other new forms of work. Not because they want to but because they are pretty much forced into it.

Crypto is one of the only leveling fields for them and I am happy they have it. Rise and fall with crypto is their responsibility. Many Smart people got rekt in 2008 die to their unwise real estate investment along with stupid ones. Some  Smart students will get rekt ii n crypto. But at least it is there for them. And I would like to think they will do much more DD and DYOR than many older people getting into crypto now.

2021-05-02,"This is a solid post that should be at the top of the front page. I’m not a major crypto gambler nor do I hold a large position, I’m only recently learning everything about the future of currency. 

10 years ago I was in college and I had a great friend that dropped out because he made some amazing gains off of the then booming Netflix/Apple ran tech boom. He made a killing, an absolute killing, and sold all of his investments to start his life. Problem is, he didn’t really position himself a safety net with any work experience, and no education. 5 or so years later he had spent through most of his massive gains and really only had a house and a bunch of stuff to his name. Started investing again but kept making bad decisions, and eventually joined the workforce to secure a steady income. I would say he ended up one of the lucky ones, and was able to set his life up so that now in his 30s he has a pretty normal life, and some job security. 

I’m sure a few of you guys can make a huge pile of gains and a few of those guys can keep it going for life, but it really is a gamble. It’s best to do this gamble as hardcore as you want but as OP said, get a job too, or even an education. If it doesn’t work out you’ll be a broke 30 year old just annoyed that you’re having to snag a job stocking groceries."
2021-05-02,"Too many people in the mindset of 'I will invest x of my pocket money in coin y and I am set for life'. 

It is fine to go all in when your parents are providing for you but assume that crypto will come crashing down tomorrow or your coin is not going to do 1000x. Diversify your income kids, get good degree and good job. It's hard to invest if you don't have any fiat to do it."

2021-05-02,"Crypto derailed my education back in 2013ish. Had people break into my dorm room and steal some of the mining equipment I had. I’ve struggled with mining back and forth. Seems like I’ve always “missed” gains over these few years. I was always getting in or getting out at the wrong time. Oh well, Bitcoin isn’t the same as it was. I remember people getting all giggly because they bought a pizza with BTC. 

But I went back to school last year and I’m supposed to graduate in 2022. So that will be nice and I’ll finally be able to close a chapter in my life. Having that degree will ease my mind a bit. It’s hard with working full-time and having weird health issues.

I live in a HCOL city/state, frequently I’ll run into nice cars with crypto related vanity plates. I’ll hear about people who made some serious money mining. It’s brings up a mixed bag of feelings that’s for sure. I’d love to be able to go to school full-time and take care of my health issues without worrying about surviving.

That’s what I hoped crypto would bring me. Just a safety net so I can finally finish school, work the job I want, and be healthy."

2021-05-02,Thank you for the advice. I'm 30+ too but sadly I'm a student. I can't focus on studies anymore and my job helps me pay the rent and bills. Crypto is my way out. I can't stop but focus on crypto everyday.

Nothing could have been more ingeniously designed to maximize the suffering, and also to insure that as few people as possible escape the common misfortune. The fortunate speculator who had funds to answer the first margin call presently got another and equally urgent one, and if he met that there would still be another. In the end all the money he had was extracted from him and lost. The man with the smart money, who was safely out of the market when the first crash came, naturally went back in to pick up bargains. The bargains then suffered a ruinous fall. Even the man who waited for volume of trading to return to normal and saw Wall Street become as placid as a produce market, and who then bought common stocks would see their value drop to a third or a fourth of the purchase price in the next 24 months. The Coolidge bull market was a remarkable phenomenon. The ruthlessness of its liquidation was, in its own way, equally remarkable.”

2021-11-08,"I can’t. They’re all ERC20 tokens that cost $300 to move 😂

Edit: I should specify I mean ‘convert the ERC20 token’ specifically in the Coinbase wallet."
2021-11-08,"You should always treat ‘house money’ as your money. It should be valued just the same as the money you put in, after all, it’s now yours, and should not be considered more expendable, just because you gained it by trading. It doesn’t mean that now that your initial investment is out, that you can lose all of your gains. Your strategy just creates an opportunity cost for you and decreases your profitability, while incentivising less risk management.

The principle is anyway that what you put in you’re fine with losing to mistakes, bad investments etc, not that you risk it and take it out ASAP, and not that this money suddenly becomes expendable or fine to throw away.

I hope concept this is well received by the community, adopting the mindset of valuing all money and always practicing good risk management whether with your deposits or gains, is key to maximising profitability."
2021-11-08,…. No.
2021-11-08,"It makes sense on paper. But a lot of investments would benefit from maintaining a stronger hold, until your initial investment is a very small amount to remove.

Say you put $1k into Cake staking, and it turned into 2k. At the current % it would take over a year for this to happen. If you did that, you would ruin the exponential gains of the next year. For me to take my initial 1k out, I'd want my investment to have gone to like 20-30k first. But by that point, I may as well just leave it in if I am not aching for the money.

The time I would take out, is if I put $1k into something, it went to 30k very quickly, and I was facing a potential price drop. If you aren't selling, someone else is. That is when I would cash out. After a very quick spike. I have missed these spikes because I thought it would go higher. But I was left holding the bag as other people sold. I probably wouldn't rush for a cash-out if it grew slowly over many weeks/months/years.

However, I am more about the risk, than other people. I'm not here to turn 1k into 2k. I'm here to turn 6k into a bajillion. But I would also consider cashing out on a case-by-case basis. If you find yourself putting $100 into DogeRugCoinInuMoon, and it turns into 10k, it's ideal to consider taking something substantial out of it. Coins like that will probably struggle to live for years. And a lot of them only get one good spike before dying. Developers can easily lose interest when their coin sits at 0.00000000000534435 for months."

2021-11-08,"But if I take our half, the next time it doubles I'll only have double again instead of 4 times what I put in."
2021-11-08,My problem is I cant pull out
2021-11-08,"Disagree strongly unless you are new. Based on this I should have sold half my ETH at 160 bucks and half my BTC around 9k. On some of my shit coins that meant stellar at 6 cents, solana at 3 bucks, maker at 400 or chainlink at 2. 

Tezos I bought into 3 years ago. Just selling what I have got in staking is 3x my original buy in. 

Buy and have an exit plan for what you want and can expect from previous cycles. I bought in 16, 17, and started again in 2020. 

Also as I am in the US short term and long term gains are different so selling half at 2x dosent even cover what you put in. 

But if you are getting in right now and knowing we got a couple months before the market turns taking profits above 2x makes sense.

If you are going long term it dosent."

2021-11-08,The thing that stops me from doing that is that taking out the initial investment is a taxable event.
2021-11-08,"From an investing standpoint, this is a fallacy. Your original investment is irrelevant. It doesn't matter whether you invested $1, $100 or $1m. What you've got now is what you've got now and that's all that matters. A dollar of the value rise you've gained is worth $1. A dollar you put in initially is worth $1. There's no difference.

We did this war on terror, didn't work so well either. 

Anytime we declare war on something the something wins. 

The government getting involved will 100% bring more attention to the scene. Some folks will buy in just because they're telling you not to. The Republicans will be all about crypto if the democrats push to restrict it. I've already had a few red friends call me asking how to buy btc in the last few weeks.

Our dynamic here is very unique and almost any law passed can be amended or repealed. Don't think that just because a bill gets through this year doesn't mean it won't be removed next year. This isn't permanent, this isn't forever.

One thing I want to really emphasize is regardless of your political affiliations, crypto regulation is a problem for us all. We can use this topic to reach an accord with others we may not normally agree with. Let this be a bridge, not a pitfall and never let a good crisis go to waste. We need to unify."

Aside from this bullish news, I generally believe that if it sticks the landing and delivers on its promises, Cardano could very well thrive on DeFi, creating more competition and maybe single-handedly increasing the quality of the whole crypto sphere."
2021-04-27,"So, obviously, this is insane news and I see a lot of people asking how this could benefit Cardano financially. Well, the way I see it, Cardano is actually sinking its claws deep into the roots of a country's financial ecosystem by becoming an identity provider. In this article, we're mainly focusing on education and keeping an individual's track record but this will surely evolve to also include credit history as well as loads of important data required to provide loans, insurances, and other financial services that most African countries can't actually benefit from right now. If you look back at IOHK presentations from 5 years ago, this is exactly the problem they have been trying to solve and everything is coming together as we speak!  
Congrats to IOHK"

I keep on reading very promising news and stories shared by users in this sub which give you a lot of hope that crypto and blockchain tech will change the world for the better.

I personally think crypto fails at its main objective - being actual currency, and people just buy them because they hope/know their value will increase in the future. I don't think something that can crash and surge 15% in less than a week is a good currency. Shit on fiat all you want but at least the Euro and petrol dollar are relatively stable.

2021-09-05,"For mass adoption, the crypto space needs to be considered ""safe"". If it's safer to keep your computer cash under your computer mattress rather than in the computer money ecosystem (whether that be exchanges, dapps, staking pools or whatever), then I feel it's much less likely everyone will want to get involved. Are we there yet? No idea. But it should definitely be a goal."

2021-09-05,"It isn't so black and white.  Yes the value of your coins needs to be high enough to justify moving it off an exchange and yes the risk may not be high should you leave it on an exchange like Coinbase.

However, security on exchanges is not perfect and regulation changes can impact on users, for example, the reducing of withdrawal limits on Binance.

It is fundamentally true that assuming you don't do anything stupid, the only way to have complete control over your crypto is to hold in a cold wallet.  

That said, there is a trade-off for me as I am staking my ETH on an exchange for the rewards, so you have to make your own mind-up on the cost-benefits re keeping on an exchange vs a cold wallet."
2021-09-05,"Using both is the best way.

Cold Wallet for big chunks of investments and Exchange for (day)trading, staking, lending, etc."
2021-09-05,"If you verify and use 2FA then you should be pretty safe keeping your coins on big exchanges like Binance, kucoin, Kraken or coinbase"
2021-09-05,"For the record, Mt.Gox was very popular; It was bitcoins top exchange at the time. 

A larger more widely used exchange does not guarantee safety. Do not be lured into a false sense of security.

Unless you are day trading - You should custody your own keys for anything you cannot afford to lose, and that number will vary depending on the persons personal circumstances."
2021-09-05,"Damn, you could have said this earlier, I just bought a ledger for my 0.001 BTC"
2021-09-05,"As long as all security features such as 2FA are enabled on the exchange then it's not the end of the world, correct.

Any exchange can die, any exchange can be hacked, any exchange can be rug pulled. Yes it's unlikely. Doesn't mean it won't happen though.

It comes down to each individuals risk/reward ratio.

Personally exchanges don't do it for me."

2021-09-05,"The whole Exchange stuff, is more an ideological thing, since most crypto enthusiasts just hate any for of centralization

However, moving small amount of crypto outside the Exchanges may be not worth (Expecially if you have high fees coins like ETH)

Cold wallet are only useful for those who have a lot of crypto

However exchanges can be considered the banks of the crypto world, and they can end up doing any shenenigans fiat banks can do (not that they will, but definitely they can), exchanges can easily put an hold on your assets for any given reason, now if you have a negligible ammount it may be not a big deal, but for those that have like 10k USD worth of crypto, it may be a problem

Personally i think that for small investors isn't a bad idea to keep funds on the exchange (Expecially if the fees are pretty high) however big investors should probably move their crypto to cold wallets (unless they plan to spot trade)"

Right now I think I have mentioned it in passing to 1 person and my mother so 2 people total.   The other person I just mentioned that you had to be careful buying shitty stocks and crypto curriencies They may not even have realized I was coming from the point of a crypto owner
2021-12-13,We need more people buy high and sell low. I can’t keep doing that alone
2021-12-13,Lol hopefully they learned to never tell anyone again to invest in crypto. If people come to you asking for advice give at er.

2021-12-13,"This is why you don’t talk about the gains. Talk about the tech, talk about the revolution, talk about the problem it’s solving and the different ways it does it. 

Never talk about how you’re getting rich because of it because you could either lose half your money in an instant or because your friends and family would look at you different. Beyond that, you absolutely do not want anyone close to you feel FOMO and invest into crypto on “your advice” or “because of what you said.” That’s a recipe for disaster."

I'm sure if I had been a member here for years the decrease in quality posts would be upsetting to me as well, but I'm sure this was a problem realized before moon implementation and everything still went forward because it can truly make a difference! Whether the posts about people changing their lives with moons are true or not, certain users have definitely earned a decent to large sum of money simply for contributing to a subreddit.

I mean that is possible, but not with highly established companies. In 3 years my Nvidia has gone up 280% - you need to keep your ear to the ground, do some serious reading, diversify your holdings and take a risk - that's how investment works. 

I hold stocks, bonds and crypto and am also a millenial. Crypto is the least certain with the highest risk reward profile - so when you say its the only option for millennials, that's like saying ""I want to get rich and be certain of it"". That doesnt exist. 99% of the cryptos out there willl hold no financial value within 5 years - I have about 10% of my portfolio in crypto because I know that the likelihood of the majority of my profit sitting there within 20 years is extremely uncertain, whereas my stocks, bonds and dividends will be what ensures I'm comfortable later in life.

Um, I think you could probably expect a reasonable amount of appreciation in value from buying and holding Apple and Amazon at current valuations. Both seem increasingly likely to invade the healthcare technology segment (Apple through wearables, software and on-device data analysis, and Amazon through telemedicine and drug sales), which is likely going grow explosively over the next decade.

Neither is likely to grow as explosively as ""crypto"", but the majority of crypto is probable worthless, whereas Apple is unlikely to go to zero any time soon. Also, if you need a downpayment for a house, your crypto could quite easily be anywhere between +10,000% and -90%, so.. I'd probably hold an ETF (maybe tech-weighted, if you're so inclined), and lightly speculate on crypto. Certainly no more than 20% of your portfolio should be anywhere near crypto, and if it is, most should be in coins with serious network effect and doxxed teams."

2021-06-11,"tldr; The Texas Department of Banking has issued a notice confirming that state-chartered banks may store cryptocurrency on clients' behalf, provided they have ""adequate protocols in place"" for complying with the law. The notice gives interested banks the option to store copies of private keys or even accept cryptocurrency transfers into wallets controlled by the banks.

Bitcoin being held by banks and treating it like fiat currency is the antithesis of the Cryptocurrency ethos. 

While I expect/expected financial institutions to accept cryptocurrency as legal tender, they're now going to be able to hold it in reserve. What's worse, is that because of it's hybrid nature, I suspect they'll be able to artificially inflate and devalue it as required for their performance bonuses and shareholders.  

Maybe I'm being cynical, but this is just one man's opinion."

2021-11-17,"While the sentiment here is valid, I think it’s way more complicated than this.  

Yes, often retail money changes hands between retail investors, but the thing you need to realize is that crypto completely inverted the typical tech start-up funding scheme.  

When you look at success stories like Uber or Facebook, what you find is wallstreet investors, Venture Capital companies, various institutions, and really wealthy individuals get involved super early before the companies are public.  

Ordinary people often can’t even legally invest in stuff like that (see accredited investors), or are otherwise excluded from the opportunity.  Then, once the companies valuation soars, they go public and those early investors dump their stock on retail investors.  This is after most of the gains have already been had.  

Crypto is inverted.  Retail has been driving the growth for most of the gains, but only recently are big institutions even allowed to become involved.  For the first time in forever, ordinary retail investors like us can dump on the institutions and wallstreet.  

The only retail investors that ever get screwed are the ones who buy without due diligence, panic sell, or buy on leverage.  Most of us aren’t in those categories.  So, I don’t agree with you, in a general sense.  

If you made good choices when you bought, the people who are really driving up the prices going forward are huge institutions and wallstreet.  

I say fuck em.  They’re going to have to drive the price up quite a bit further before my gains “trickle down” on those peon institutions.

2022-01-06,"You feel this way because you are new.
I have been in crypto since 2017.
I have held and witnessed several horrific crashes, some long term crashes, dozens of 10% and 5% and even at the start of covid a 80%. 

If during at any of those many many crashes I had puchased more I would have at a later point made money every single time.

There was a time when 19k was the ath then it dipped over the course of months all the way to 3k and people thought it would never hit 20k again. 

They arent exactly full of shit but some are just memeing. If you think crypto is here to stay which the past 10 years has shown indeed it is. Buying and holding and you will eventually get your money back. Eventually. Not the next day. Sometimes not even the next year but you will.

We had an entire crash just because everyone flooded to doge as their first buy then when they got exit scam all fled because they assumed all of crypto was a scam. People are so impatient. There are people who barely made 50% on a stock hold after 5 years and you guys start losing your minds when you didnt triple your money in a week. Have some perspective."

2022-01-06,"*Just buy whatever the fuck you want, at whatever price you want*

Well, no. This is just reckless and bad advice. Even if you are a HODL’er, this violates the fundamental investing premise: buy low, sell high. You are giving terrible advice by essentially just telling people to ape in regardless of the circumstances. Don’t do this. 

The whole premise of ‘buying the dip’ is a casual reminder to ‘buy low, sell high.’ It’s important for people to remember that, because it’s really the best way to succeed without pure gambling. Can you know whether the dip is over? Of course not, things could always go to zero. But you can look at historical price data, see when things are overvalued and oversold, and purchase accordingly. You want to buy when things are on sale. You want to sell when things are punching all time highs. Then when those ATHs come back down, which they always will, you want to start laddering back in. 

‘Buying the dip’ also doesn’t mean ‘go all in once you see a crash’. Try to ascertain where price will likely start finding historic buying pressure, and start scaling in your purchases. This is all pretty common sense stuff here…"

2021-09-07,"Taking profits with the aim to rebuy later is tricky. 
1. You have 1 BTC.
2. Price goes to 50k. 
3. You sell 10% and have 0.9 BTC and $5000
4. Price dips 25% but realistically you manage to  buy at 20% discount.
5. You now have 1.025 BTC
6. So you risked 10% and gained 2.5%

Let’s see scenario B:
1. You sell 10%
2. Price dips by 18% and you miss your buying chance.
3. You have your $5000 which is great as it was an original investment of say $1000.
4. But you have just 0.9 BTC now and the price keeps going up.

What I mean to say is that taking profits is great as long as you’re ready for this money to keep being profit. If you sell planning to buy lower, you have a disproportionate risk. 

Of course nobody went poor by taking profit."

2022-10-03,That’s not enough in my opinion! People lost their life saving by “trusting” her. If you promote a scam you should compensate every damage done in my opinion!
2022-10-03,"Hate this comment if you want, but this is the space where regulation would exist.

I hate all the celebrity endorsement stuff and am definitely not a fan of 'ole Kimmy but really, there isn't much difference\* between what she did and what Matt Damon or Larry David did when they promoted cryptos. None of these people were actually involved in the underlying thing, they were just paid celebrities hired for a job to try and sell the product.

\* where Kim is different is, she didn't disclose it was an ad and faked that it was organic. So, the SEC fined her for the only thing that regulation covers. Endorsing a financial implement without disclosing she was paid. The fine was all the money (+ interest) she made plus $1M.

You also need to remember, the only difference between a totally shitcoin (like EthMax) and a shitcoin that people generally accept isn't a scam (like Doge) is enough people just believing it is ok. If enough people believed in EthMax and it just crashed 50-90% like everything else in this bear market, people would just make fun of her like Matt Damon.

It is even technically possible (I'm not saying this is the case) that even Kim feels cheated. She may have little knowledge of the crypto space (someone as rich as her should have people who can find out for her though) and genuinely thought it was a good idea. Now her name (which is the only thing of real value she has) is associated with this shit.

As to the regulation side. This is the reason accredited investors rules were brought in. Investment opportunities only available to accredited investors have many fewer reporting requirements to potential investors. The idea is that, accredited investors have the financial means to survive a higher risk investment and also should have either the knowledge or money to pay someone to truly dive into an investment opportunity before risking their money. Stuff open to everyday investors instead has to have much more robust disclosure information and modelling before offering it to everyday people. 

All the people in this thread saying she should be fined more or charged with something more, are asking for regulation! They got her with what they have regulations for, nothing more, nothing less."

I'm staking the coins I can and accumulating that way. But for the ones I can't stake I'm tempted to try and sell high and buy back at a lower cost. The problem with that is that I am horrible at trying to predict which way the market will go and for how long. So I'm going to just keep buying a little every week and forget trying to time the market."
2021-05-23,"In hindsight, once the price has dropped it always looks like you should have taken profit.

But in practice, if you try to take profit most of the time you'll fuck it up. You'll be praying every day for a dip, and just watch the price keep going higher instead.

Then end up buying higher, and that's when it dips.

Or you might think you're lucky, and you might be able to buy the dip, but then it keeps dipping.

Or worse, you could create a situation for yourself where you end up owing more tax than you can afford, by continuously creating realized gains, then putting that money right back into crypto. Which could drop on you. It's a dangerous game."

2021-05-23,Sometimes it's okay to sell guys
2021-05-23,"""It's important to know when to sell,""

All due respect, but posts like these are not informed.  No bell will ring to tell you when it is time to sell.  No magic buzzer goes off.  'Know when to sell' is a literal superpower, I might as well know when to fly, they have almost equal probability of occurring.  Let me be clear, if you ""know when to sell"", then you should be leading the most prominent hedge fund in the world.

On appreciating assets, whether it is the stock market or bitcoin, those that sell with the intent to buy lower **will not succeed the overwhelming majority of the time**.  This is why it is known that most daytraders lose money.  Don't lie to yourself that you'll predict the top, you won't, ever.  And if you do, that will be cataclysmic for you, as it will go to your head and you'll make very stupid bets the next time based on your false belief in your ability - you'll lose more then.

If you want to take profit with no intent of getting back in, either because you need cash at the moment or because you are leveraged (never do this) or because you don't believe in the asset anymore (cough DOGE cough), then have at it - this is perfectly fine and reasonable.  But if you panic sell on dips to try and hold onto your profits (or stop your losses) on an asset you like, you will find  yourself selling low and then fomo-buying high (or not ever buying in again).  Not to mention **taxes** (if preserving a beaten-down gain).

IMPORTANT EDIT: I think it is reasonable advice to sell your initial invested amount after a massive run up so that you are playing with house money.  I typically don't do this, as I don't sell something I believe in, but I get it.  However, posts like OP can encourage novice investors to move 100% in and out - this will lead to failure often.

How many dips did bitcoin have on the way from $1 til now?  How many of those people sold, believing in ""taking profits""?  And what % do you actually think got back in at a lower price and then STAYED IN for the massive gains?  We know the answer to this.

HODL isn't just a meme, it's is an objectively good investment method.  It is the method of Warren Buffet and just about every single rich person on this earth.  How do you think Jeff Bezos got so rich?  You think he sold all of his Amazon stock when it doubled? Or tripled? Nope.  They don't day-trade, they know that they can't time tops.  They **hold onto assets that they believe in.** Learn from them."

2021-05-23,I agree. People who have tons of disposable income to hold are always mocking the “take profits” stance saying you’re losing out but I think a lot of noob investors and small time investors in general would’ve come out on top of this dip and had some extra money to buy the dip during this FUD if they had simply took profits. I think a lot of folks including myself lost sight of our safe investment codes for greedy and fell prey to FOMO and took losses. If you aren’t willing to lose everything I think taking profits and resisting FOMO even if the market goes up is the safest investing method and I’ve definitely learned my lesson going forward. Only way out now is to HODL and hope for the best/prepare for the worst. I have high hopes for ETH/ADA/LINK/CAKE/BNB etc.

I don't lie : i have some shitcoins too, but all are max 50$
Today i see Discount of ETH and BTC i split my gain in those two and by it.

If your answer is yes, then dca-ing, forgetting about it, growing your stack slowly is the easiest thing to do. It really is. If your answer is no or you’re not sure, then follow the advice given here in this thread already and sell when you’ve reached your PRE-DETERMINED  limit.
And don’t keep your coins on exchanges unless you have zero other options. Even then, find an option.

Edit: 
Also, how to FOMO if you can’t help yourself:

Buy a small bag of said fomo coin. Now you have some, and can get through your breakfast. By small I mean small. Then continue to do your research, watch it’s development (price wise or tech wise). If your interest in it after a little while is still there, start your dca-ing in. If not, move it to btc, and forget."

2021-03-11,"Sorry but I would not agree here. I have been there in 2017 and sold my bags for small profit in 2018. This is probably the worse crypto decision I have ever made.

Since then crypto investing for me is one way street. I  will only cash out when half of my holdings become 'life changing amount'. For me this means being able to quit my job on spot and live of % invested in less volatile assets. Other 50% will most likely stay and ride the wave. Until then my holdings have ZERO value.

I prefer to see my coins actually go to 0 - at this point i can say 'meh.. i tried' - than become yet another 'bitcoin pizza' guy."

2021-02-15,"Came in hoping for a guide to defi, but got clickbaited instead, so pretty disappointed."
2021-02-15,"This really is not the ultimate guide

1/2 is not passive

no yield staking / lending

\+ there are more passive oportunities"
2021-02-15,"Alright you missed a feew big ones....

1. [Harvest.finance](https://Harvest.finance) Its a yield aggregator. It does staking, and you don't need to lock your tokens. They make money by charging a performance fee of 30% for executing strategies en masse. Those strategies compound gains on on thousands of accounts at once for the cost of a single account doing the operation. The project hands out farm tokens to people who stake, and the performance fee is used to buy farm tokens off the open market and then stream them to people staking said farm tokens. Needless to say, it is still worth it, because it cuts gas costs of executing a vbery high performance daily compounding strategy to ZERO for the end users. Because of this, harvest finance is able to realize yields of higher than 100% for partner strategies, and yields of 30-90% for people staking farm.
2. 88mph. Another aggregator. This one allows people to sell the rights to the interest on their investments. Then people get 88mph tokens which they can use to claim the proceeds of the sale of governor tokens of other projects. Their liquidity mining is not bad either.
3. badger dao. An interesting project that is pushing a rebasing token known as digg that targets 1:1 with btc. Its like ampleforth but better.
4. [surf.finance](https://surf.finance) This is a very righteously wicked cool project. There are 10 million surf in circulation with no more allowed to be minted. 1% of every transaction is sent to the whirlpool which distributes the divs to people providing liquidity to the surf protocol. They have multiple dapps being built including surf3d, surfstacker and a casino project. Again... righteous.
5. Cream. Gaaaaah gold standard for defi lending right after comp, but cream has more tokens..."
2021-02-15,Do you have to make a top post or comment to get moons?
2021-02-15,"I wouldn't call this the ultimate guide. You didn't mention options, farming, etc"
2021-02-15,"I've been running **masternodes** for the past 3 years, and truly love the passive income I yield every month.   
I'm currently running 26 nodes spread over multiple projects. BLOCK, XSN, DIVI and many more.   
The easiest node I've ever setup though is through the **DIVI wallet**. All it takes is 1 click to deploy a node, and they've got 5 different tiers yielding 20-25% annually on your investment.   
Staking DIVI is fun too, as they have weekly lottery draws among stakers.   
50 coins from every block accumulate for the weekly lottery block fund. Every 10,080 blocks, a lottery cycle completes and one stake is rewarded with a 252,000 $DIVI lottery reward, and ten other stakes are rewarded with 25,200 $DIVI lottery rewards. 10,000 $DIVI must be in a staked wallet to be eligible to win a lottery block.    


Masternodes is seen as ""scams"", or ""money grabs"", but all you really gotta do is do your own research.  
There's tons of awesome projects out there, you gotta look for projects which offers ""more"" than just masternodes and staking.   
DIVI offers and builds a newbie friendly crypto experience for everyone. Human readable blockchain addresses is one example.   


Dash which was the first masternode around focuses on privacy, and mass adoption among un-banked countries, which means it's a very popular crypto in countries like Venezuela.   
Blocknet and Stakenet. makes it possible to earn through their DEX trading fees.  


Great write up, but you definitely miss **masternodes** on that list."

2021-02-15,"You should stake using native wallets whenever possible.  Don’t keep your coins on Binance for extended periods of time - it centralizes the stake and therefore undermines the consensus protocol.  Also, not your keys, not your coins.  Don’t be part of the next Mt Gox (or Quadriga, or any of the other exchanges that have gone bust).

That means using the Daedalus or Yoroi wallet for staking with Cardano - I don’t know about the other PoS coins but perhaps others can chime in.  If in doubt, ask in the subreddit for your specific coin."

2021-02-15,BlockFi
2021-02-15,Stopped reading when earning Reddit moons was considered passive or even worth.
2021-02-15, Tezos also has staking!
2021-02-15,"At a very basic level, “staking” means locking your crypto assets in a proof-of-stake blockchain for a certain period of time. These locked assets are used to achieve consensus, which is required to secure the network and ensure the validity of every new transaction to be written to the blockchain. Those who stake their coins in a PoS blockchain are usually called “validators.” For locking their assets and providing services to the blockchain, validators are rewarded with new coins from the network.
For a blockchain to perform efficiently, validators are required to provide stable and secure services. To run a successful validator node, an agent needs to be committed to a selected blockchain and run a secure and continuously available infrastructure. 

If you provide a service and get a reward for it, that does not count as passive income. So only if you delegate coins (like Tezos) with a built-in mechanism that allows anyone who does not want to be a validator to delegate their coins to a validator on the network and then performs all the work and shares the reward with their delegators - or Particl’s coldstaking script, that delegates your staking weight to a pool, where you „team up” with other stakers and combine your staking powers in order to earn more frequent staking rewards. These examples should be associated with passive income when it comes to staking, because staking in itself is securing the network, and a stake is the reward.

2021-11-16,Yeah THOSE people are crazy. Unlike some of us who dump thousands into unknown shitcoins for a chance to get rich
2021-11-16,"Lol this sub and NFTs sheesh.

Your first mistake was trying to rationalize the NFT market in USD. NFT liquidity and the cascade of interest from Ethereums earliest investors and contributors is not denoted in USD.

The projects that typically do the best are responsible for writing novel code to Ethereum. Quality NFT projects are successful because the engineers/earlies appreciate them. Thus the NFT craze is really an enthusiasm for the network, paired with those at insanely different economies of scale, with a lot of participation from those for whom 100Eth, just isnt all that much. (Another commonly missed point, is ""fuck your norms, fuck what used to be important, fuck disney, fuck the corpos, *this* is what's important to us"" mentality)

You have to actually venture into the space and participate to truly understand what NFTs have done, and are doing on a larger scale. Through NFTs, DAOs have been able to experiment and practice rapid formation, assembling massive community funded treasuries in less than an hour, along with boilerplate (lol) governance and diminished trust choke points. The amount of focused liquidity a new DAO formed around a project can provide is a force, and has no rival in tradfi/corporate/traditional ventures when it comes to rapidity.

Other great things for which NFT enthusiasm is mostly responsible:
Wallet UI/functionality advances
Novel/Composable network additions (code legos)
Advances in NFT usage in DeFi/collateralization
Minimalist (efficient) focused engineering (for on chain projects)


So again, the NFT market is only truly made possible by the most enthusiastic and deeply invested persons on the network (those who built and initially funded it.) Choosing to own an NFT on whatever grounds is a personal decision. Ignoring the movement and its products is foolish."
2021-11-16,"If you ""spent a few minutes on opensea"", it's possible you may not have done the research necessary in order to accurately value NFTs.

Like Crypto, things in a decentralized environment are going to have a lot of stupid things. NFTs will have a lot of worthless things. Crypto will have a lot of worthless coins.

However, if your fully fleshed out definition of NFTs is ""an 8 bit viking with a stripe shirt"", it sounds exactly like someone unfamiliar with cryptocurrency describing bitcoin as ""a scam used by criminals""."

2021-05-14,"I know this won’t get much visibility. Hell, you may not even see it, but I’ll write it anyways.

We started out bartering. Trade me some bear meat and I’ll give you a bunch of arrowheads. A wolf pelt? I’ll give you these berries.

But there were issues with that. You couldn’t always get what you wanted. If my berries went bad before wolf pelt season was in, I’d miss out on a wolf pelt, and you’d miss out on my berries. So, we started trading gold. It couldn’t go bad, so you could pay me gold for my berries, then I’d pay you gold for your wolf pelts later on.

But eventually, gold became a problem. It was heavy, loud, not as easy to morph and mass-produce coins as we’d like. So we moved on to the bank note. Lightweight, mostly durable, easy to fit in your pocket, easy to make lots of.

Unfortunately, we can’t transfer the bank note at the speed of light, so we started making digital money. Paypal can transfer your money across the world in a fraction of a second.

But now, there’s the issue of security, scalability, and loads of other problems that come with FIAT money. (\*ahem\* inflation during crises)  So, we created DeFi. Nobody owns bitcoin itself. There’s no government to print out more when the going gets tough. No surprise inflation.

But crypto has its issues. The wide array of different cryptocurrencies has turned crypto into a highly-volatile, glorified stock market. And it’s easily subject to manipulation.

It’s time for an improvement. The next step. It will still be crypto, but different. How could we solve this problem, the problem of manipulation from stronger people? I haven’t the faintest clue.

The problems are getting harder. It started out as “Grug need pelt but berry go bad. Grug use intermediate wealth storage to avoid asset depreciation.”  With crypto, it was, “How can I create a decentralized currency, capable of evading the problems caused by the handling of a government? Where the value belongs to the individual, not a higher power.”

This last hurdle is huge. How will we stop a wannabe-Tony Stark from pumping an asset’s value? We can’t just program rules in place or try to take control when the market gets wonky. That’s wholly against what crypto stands for.

Always be on the lookout for new technology. You need to be ahead of the market. Be those people on the bitcoin forums, the people who jumped on bitcoin when it got listed.

There’s a solution. We just don’t see it yet."
2021-05-14,"As soon as the 1% realized there was even more money to be made in cryptocurrency they started forcing entry into the cockpit of cryptocurrency...
And furthermore when have the 1% not been in atleast partial control of the major investments in the US?
And of course this bothers me the only way to have power over the 1% is to become the 1% or use the collective strength of our community and I hate to say it but thats how WSB took on the hedgies if not temporarily.

2021-05-14,">What happened to the anonymous - that now requires more identification than you would to open a bank account.

These are regulations mandated by the authorities, not crypto. Precisely because crypto challenges the status quo, the established order will fight back. Expect more, usually following propaganda to sway the masses before trying to crack down/inhibit even more. 

>What happened to the peer to peer - that now goes through middlemen exchanges who ""own"" your wallets.

We're still peer-to-peer. In fact, that function can never be taken away. Use of any exchange is a choice, for good or bad. Again, centralized exchanges are companies, subject to the whim of authorities. Crypto is not to blame for the fact that people ""must"" employ exchanges for fiat on- and off-ramps. 

>What happened to cypherpunks? The dreamers? 

They're still here, still fighting. However, from making up 100% of the crypto-space in the beginning, it's only logical that this percentage drops as newer, and by definition, less ideologically inclined people are entering. At some point, the overwhelming majority will consist of Number Go Up-enthusiasts rather than Enslavement Go Down-idealists.

It's not up to a handful of cypherpunks to ""form a new world"". That's legacy thinking. The secret to crypto is organic growth, which is diametrically opposed to our current top-down systems."

2021-05-14,"It's interesting that anyone thinks big money influence and government regulation wouldn't and won't happen. What fantasy world are you living in where suddenly reality and historical influence changes? They have ALWAYS been involved and that's not changing any time soon. Social media has made it even easier especially for the wealthy to influence thoughts and opinions. Not under the current system and it'll take more than crypto to change that. Thinking otherwise is just a pipe dream (wet dream?).

Currency flow is critical to both national and international economies and the more cryptocurrencies become adopted and mainstream the sooner it'll happen. Facts of life. Especially when law enforcement and national intelligence gets involved.

You can try to operate illegally and ""off the radar"" but when the tax man cometh they will find you, sooner or later, the number of ways they can nail you is rather fascinating. I know this sounds rude and defeatist but conversely most of the cries for a decentralized, government-free currency sound like idealist high schoolers to me. Nothing wrong with the idea but ignoring the bigger problem. There's nothing here to change the historical cycle of power. Governments will continue to have oversight in a multitude of ways and not all directly tied to crypto. Legislation will be enacted if needed and the vast majority of people aren't going to be willing to risk operating illegally. The wealthy will continue to have large influence as long as they have access and blocking them is hypocritical from a crypto standpoint (gatekeeping).

What makes you think anonymity is guaranteed from a government standpoint while having mainstream acceptance (without mainstream acceptance the incentive dwindles)?

What makes you think peer-to-peer would stay government free if it involves buying, selling, or trading especially when it can be tied to criminal activity and *will* be framed as a matter of national security (magical phrase)?

Dreaming is great and all but this idea of a cryptocurrency that the masses have the option to adopt and use that is legal *and* free from government oversight/influence in addition to the influence of the ultra-wealthy who influence literally every other aspect of life on this planet has never addressed the real obstacle, government legislation, is just funny. People though the Dark Web would offer what crypto hopes to offer and we've all seen what happened there and it includes cryptocurrency. Foolish to think they can't eventually trace crypto.  The masses aren't willing to operate illegally and the penalties for doing so can destroy futures and retirement possibilities. Most people aren't willing to risk that for what cryptocurrency offers.

Just my cynical opinion. Ideally I am proven wrong."

- How was he able to use his parent's house as collateral if the house's value only fulfilled 16% of the bail bond,  and 1.6% of the full $250M?

- Why was he released with the promise of getting 2 co-signers on the $250M agreement? Shouldn't he have secured those names prior to release? Moreover, he never even put up the $25M so is the cosigner going to help complete the 10%?

- How was he able to use his parent's house if they are being investigated for using FTX funds? 

- Shouldn't the parent's assets be frozen? Especially since the interim CEO declared that they received FTX funds?

I know it sounds fun and you think you could do it but spending $8billion would be a full time job. And no way you can hide that kind of money/real assets.

Many of our posts make frequent references to life changing money and that you have to go big or go home. Frankly, I think that's a really dangerous climate for new investors (in this space or any other)

In the long-run crypto as an asset class should be fine - this isn't the first time the price of crypto has sky rocketed and quickly plummeted to the ground. You just have to realize that investing is a marathon and not a 12 month sprint. Your investment plan \*should\* layout how you handle big drops like this, and you should plan your personal finances in a way that you don't need to liquidate crypto in the short-term to cover your basic life expenses or minor emergencies (e.g., car repairs)."

I answered their tweet and told them that it got published on a 4 mln subscribers forum. They ain’t got the balls to say their policy loudly, their tweet was an answer to one of their customers, so we will do that for them. Thanks for sharing here.

The idea of it is so profound that it seems like every time you peel away a layer of analysis, there's another more interesting and paradigm shattering layer, like an onion. Its a currency, which means it doesn't work unless everyone understands its value. It's also ""decentralized"", which means no one person, or organization can fraudulently manipulate it or destroy it. It also uses cryptography to verify transactions, which is a discipline all its own. The software, with a mind of its own, rewards the participants for their hard work with the currency they are supporting. However, it's made it really difficult to find a graphics card, so can you guys....like, chill a little bit."

EDIT: claimed I sold for a loss but just thinking of the profit I missed out on, I knew it was going to be pumped again too and was hoping to wait until a couple zeros were knocked off, guess I'll wait until this dump is complete and buy back in, wait for the next cycle🤡🤣😭😭"
2021-10-28,Next time let us know before 🤡
2021-10-28,I think you should be proud that you didn't try to take out a loan to buy crypto. You didn't spend more than you have and that's smart. Many people gamble with money they don't have. You could have gotten rekt.
2021-10-28,We are all shib billionaires in our minds?
2021-10-28,Let me guess ... Shib? Find comfort in the fact that we are still in the early days of crypto. When BTC is at $1 million and Alt coins are similarly through the roof you will look back and realize you were fortunate to buy in when you eventually did.

2022-12-09,"Just had a run through the comments. Feels like everyone just read the title and completely ignored the article itself. 

The guy is saying that he doesn’t feel he earned these money and it really bothers him. 
Also, now, when he has plenty of money, he is in completely new and unfamiliar mindset and struggling to find excitement he used to have. As the tons of money extinguished all the fire in him.

The guy is not bored. He just feel lost and likely on the way to depression constantly thinking he’s unworthy and without a purpose."
2022-12-09,"It is. 

There’s no longer a struggle or an immediate goal to reach. You can literally buy anything you want without having to save or work for it.

The caveat is learning new skills or finding ways to invest yourself into causes and the community. 

Being wealthy is like reaching max level in World of Warcraft. You’re no longer grinding, so you max out secondary skills and enjoy endgame content - which would be life in this analogy."

2022-10-10,"I was wondering how the heck they (currently) have 5000 employees in the first place? What do they all do?

These tech companies are amazing, Google apparently has 156,500 employees (2021), Meta 71,970 (2021), but these are big, multi-faceted companies with superior systems engineering, R&D etc., [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) flogs crypto, that's all.

\> Former and current employees have reported the marketing division has been hit the hardest. According to them, the creative department was completely disbanded a few months after its inception.  
OK, so [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) is basically a marketing company, that also has a crypto exchange. That all makes perfect sense now."
2022-10-10,For those keeping score at home: this week there have been more layoffs announced in the industry than there are reported users in two of the most well known metaverse projects.

2022-10-10,"Many hate for CDC, but they do what they need to do to keep their company alive during this bearmarket (like cutting deep (very deep) into their reward system, the layoffs etc.). You would think they want to chase people away from the platform. Anyway, I prefer this then vanishing like we saw with a few other ones. 

Agree on the terrible communication from their end though."
2022-10-10,They must be saving up money for all of the big-money advertisements that will emerge during the next bull-run.
2022-10-10,"2000 is a lot of people.

2022-10-10,"I remember in 2018 my company laid of 30% of its staff, and that was a british gov. Co.
Noone was fudding that UK is going bankcrupt. I was one of them, and seen people getting sent away with 20 years behind.

Crypto.com expanded because the market pushed them to expand.

From that 2000 employees, 1800 probably customer service rep which they barely had time to train.

Unlucky and sad, but i wouldn't go too far to fear mongering . It happens all the time everywhere especially these times."

2021-10-24,"Let's give credit where it should be given. Even if he is a paid actor he has several informational videos that don't involve specific coins. The channel has videos on how to DYOR, how to plan your exit strategy, and lots of other content that doesn't involve X or Y coin reaching 100x"

2021-10-24,"Don’t trust **ANY** influencer, let alone random strangers on the internet (like on Reddit). They never have your best interests in mind… because everyone is just here to make money."
2021-10-24,"I don't know dude, his portfolio that he shares is pretty solid. He doesn't shill any shitcoins or lowcaps either. If someone pays him for shilling BTC, ETH, SOL and other top 50 coins then good for him. It's a good idea to invest in them anyway."
2021-10-24,"I'm asking this honestly. Can you verify what you have claimed with any form of proof? Can you verify that guy is a paid actor with no true knowledge of crypto? I noticed you post about coin bureau getting info wrong about algorand, and I've seen that your into algo, so I want to verify that your claims are true and your not just making claims against someone that's voiced something different then what you believe to be true.

Edit: some of the proof is the fact that on the coin bureau site it is posted that coin bureau is a brand of v3. V3 is a marketing company, which has multiple clients. Coin bureau is just another client that v3 does marketing for. It does not mean v3 owns coin bureau.

Edit 2: so far you have proven that guy is not the founder of coin bureau, but that doesn't mean he's a paid actor. His bio literally says hes been Into crypto since before coin bureau was started. He's a member of the company that started the YouTube channel on the companies behalf, or is the host of curated content. Either way, what are they guilty of, educating people?"
2021-10-24,"As someone who is extremely familiar with the space, Coin Bureau is one of the best channels out there. Well-researched, consistent, and unfiltered reviews are provided. And you get all of that *for free*. The crypto space is better because that channel exists."
2021-10-24,"Man running a business gets help running a business. Colour me surprised.

As his channel has grown I'd imagine he's needed more support and for a youtube channel to work with a marketing agency is hardly surprising. 

Guy is one of the only YouTubers who doesn't give out thinly veiled financial advice labelled as ""not financial advice"" and most of his videos are educational. Sure he gets things wrong, but in crypto it's easy to occasionally get things wrong due to the fast adapting nature of the space.

**Finally, just because you bold something - doesn't make it true**"
2021-10-24,"Well, well, well look at this, it seems OP has an agenda too.

OP seems to be shilling Algorand and Guy had a video about ALGO a week ago where he reviewed the blockchain. Later on Guy released a video, where he said that he made a mistake about some information that he presented about ALGO. Seems OP is furious with Guy and this is a personal vendetta. The post is here https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q3gu1v/coin_bureau_intentionally_releasing/"
2021-10-24,Op just mad that coinbureau won't shill his Algo bags
2021-10-24,"Well, Guy has made me alot of fucking money. His video on Harmony One, when no one was talking about it, as made me a fuck ton. His video on Avalanche has made me a decent amount. Wish I threw more money at it when it was at 38. He made a video on Fantom when it's was below a dollar, I'm up HUGE on that one too.

He makes the best crypto content on the web, doesn't just shill coins, but gives you a great breakdown of their use case, tech and price potential. He's also one of the only few youtubers who mentions a coins' tokenomics, and their vesting schedules. 

He has a great video on explaining the difference between POW and POS. Also on TA, and the Wyckoff method, which I learned alot from. Today, He released a great video on the Energy crisis and how it could effect POW, explaining the situation very well. 

Like, why would I give a FLYING RATS ASS, if theirs a company behind the channel. CLEARLY it's a high level production and not some Joe Blow in his basement. I benefit from his content, that's what I care for the most."
2021-10-24,"Gonna need a source on these claims and checking your post history, you seem to be obsessed with the guy. Getting some weird vibes..."
2021-10-24,BitBoy is that you?
2021-10-24,"I strongly disagree, I have learned so much about the crypto world from coin bureau and never got the feeling that they were shilling something to me."
2021-10-24,"I don't watch Coin Bureau, but separate writer and presenter is fairly common on YouTube and V3 Digital seems more like a publisher. Examples of likely bad faith shilling would be more interesting."
2021-10-24,"Reading a bit from your history, it just seems you don’t like their take on Algorand. And it also seems like you are all in on algorand..  
    
Anyways, coin bureau gives good information and it’s good for research when you don’t have 10 hours a day to do it. If he reports something you find interesting, best thing is to corroborate after in other more serious reports. But for a YouTuber gaving lots of information he is alright and way better than most.   
    
Don’t be mad."
2021-10-24,"“Hey guys, did you know this guy get paid to post YouTube videos? Yeah well now everything he says is wrong, evil or misleading.”

2021-12-28,If you have reached your crypto goal then there is no reason to HODL. Buy the house and good luck for the future.

2021-12-28,"My wife and I are waiting for pretty much the same thing. If we reach a point where we can use it to put a down payment on a lovely condo, I would drop all my coins in a heartbeat. I understand it's a little hard to do, but real life comes first. After that, and maybe some remodeling and furniture expenses, I can start rebuilding my portfolio.

Go enjoy a real home."

Your only chance to use it immediately is if all the funds are on an exchange. are sold into USD, transferred into your regular bank account, and most importantly the statements. They need to be very clear and cover at least 2 months. 

As for taxes, would suck to sell your bag, buy the home, then have a $30k+ tax bill due in April."

2021-12-28,"Buy the house mate. You've reached your goal. My goal was to buy a house as well.

I'll say this though, its so difficult to sell. So many times I wondered ""what if it goes higher"" I could get a house in x area instead of y area but eventually I came to realize that greed would wreck me. 

No regratz"
2021-12-28,"Buy the house

Edit: fwiw  this is such an easy call I didn't even read the whole post. You set a goal OP and you've made it. If the market pulls back now you'll be left wondering what kind of house you *could* have gotten. Buy the house. You made it gg."
2021-12-28,"It's a matter of maths.  Setting aside wifey jokes and lottery dreams of 10K+ ETH, let's look at this purely from a housing perspective. I too live in an absurdly expensive market, additionally because of a housing supply shortage and other economic factors, the housing market is generally absurd most places.  In my market, it's to the point that homes are easily and without exaggeration selling 25%+ over what their FMV should be.

So, a house that should be priced at 2M is going for 2.5M that's 400-500K that will be lost when prices normalize (or more if there's a crash).  Compare that to perhaps paying an extra 100-150K because of another point or 1.5 when interest goes up.

The fears over higher interest rates don't seem to be in line with the fears that should be in place for the next housing crash.  There doesn't even have to be a bubble burst like in 2007, the market just needs to slightly normalize with an increased supply of new homes with construction starting up again and homes will lose double digit percentages of value in a short 5yr window before they recover at an acceptable rate of appreciation.  Why see your home go underwater because maybe interest will go up a point.  Doesn't make sense.

If you're growing family can wait, then wait a couple years, it'll be worth it.  And there's always the chance for Lambo territory with your ETH Lol"
2021-12-28,"I'd buy the house, you hit your goal and your wife probably won't be happy if you leave it in there. You said it yourself, you don't know shit about fuck, and the market could trend downward while interest rates rise. You can always reinvest, and you won't miss out as much as you think."
2021-12-28,"If it’s worth anything, I was in a similar situation about 3 years ago, hit my goal, sold my BTC, and bought the house for my SO and our dog. BTC quadrupled in value since, but we’re happy with a roof over our head and the home value has appreciated 25% too so not that bad.

TLDR; buy the house!"

2022-01-09,We are at the stage that we are all here for the tech
2022-01-09,You missed between steps 4 and 5 the bounce that everyone thinks is a market reversal and suddenly the suicide hotline it replaced with “hah I told you so” or “how much did you load up on that tasty dip” etc.

2022-01-09,"Not to brag, but I didn't know shit about fuck at stage 2."
2022-01-09,Do suicide hotlines really get pinned? Until now I thought that was more like a meme than an actual thing. Really curious here.

2022-01-09,"Suicide hotline has been posted several times although it’s more for karma than for actual concern about people’s well-being so we just remove it now.

2022-01-09,"Here we go again.the 100k btc and 10k eth was a ""firm"" discussion last year."
2022-01-09,"We're at the stage where panic sellers are encouraging others to sell so they can get back in without losing out, as though we actually move the market."
2022-01-09,"This last year really does show we don't know shit about fuck. I thought he bear market was beginning in May last year after the crash. Then we ended up bouncing to a second peak. There was no way to predict that second peak really. Anyone who did ""predict it"" certainly weren't predicting the beginning of another 40% crash as they were the same people predicting 100k by EOY.

The resurgence after that initial peak shows that we're not in completely unchartered waters with crypto. You can't just rely on past markets to predict the future. This bear market could last another month, or it could last another 3 years. No one really knows. I think we're governed a lot like traditional markets now. Interest rates go up, markets go down (including crypto). Interest goes down, crypto goes up. If there's huge news like a proper vehicle for investing pensions  directly into BTC, then we'll see a big run up. Likewise if a huge country like India decides to ban crypto you can expect to see downward movement."

2021-11-12,"Penny stocks have wild swings, as well. People make these comparisons a lot but it's just because when most people refer to stock or invest in stocks (beyond WSB, of course) they are looking for consistent returns with modest risk.

Crypto is high risk high return. Return always comes with risk. We're just all here risking it for the biscuits."

2021-11-12,Yeah most of us aren't here to just to make a little extra dough.  We want to make serious money that can change our lives
2021-11-12,"No its not and there are many reasons why its not insane. It is just insane for you because you seem to either have joined only recently or you dont see the big picture. Just zoom out a little. From 2018 to 2020 we had the most devastating bear market with many coins losing 90%, some even in excess of that. On the flip side, we had an amazing run from the march 2020 lows, with an insane bullrun from late 2020 to mid 2021 and now we are back up after a 50-60% correction meanwhile. So if you have joined about 3 or 12 months ago, it seems like easy gains. If you have joined 6 months ago you may be in the green now again, meanwile enduring a solid loss of 50% of your investment. If you bought during 2017/18 mania and did nothing, you are up about 3x-4x (so 200-300%) in about 4 years.

Also, the risk you have to take to get the return in crypto is much greater than the risk you have to take to get a return with stocks. You see, a stock means you own a share of a company and even if that company is doing poorly, there is some value in it (buildings, machinery, products, brands, w/e). In crypto the value behind a coin is a combination of many things but in fact, there is nothing you can sell to recoup a portion of your loss if a coin fails. Hence it makes no sense to compare nominal returns between two or more asset classes. You always have to account for risk and other things."

2021-11-12,"Well real companies that have to produce real things don't generally go up 500% every year, 10% is more normal. However, crypto is ponzi inception. 
Of course we live in planet ponzi where all finance has incorporated ponzi mechanics backed by central banks that prints money to prevent the financial collapse of ponzis when they should collapse, so the crypto is the logical next evolution of the same stupid game except retail can play from the winning side for once."

2022-07-19,I love how this person casually sent $10m worth of BTC as their test transaction before unloading $50m-$100m transfers 😂
2022-07-19,"EDIT
I did some digging around and the wallet appears to match binance's bitcoin futures open interest. The amount of bitcoin sent to a new address matches the insurance fund of bitcoin & stablecoins. They sent some bitcoin to coinbase every now and then to buy and sell and keep the insurance fund correct dollarwise.

I'm still digging, but some things they do seem to look like heavy manipulation to grind liquidation fees to fill their ""insurance"" fund. 

-----‐-‐-------‐----------------------

By the looks of it this is coinbases collateral bitcoin wallet. They received their bitcoin back after paying off the loan and it matches the rise in volume. 

The reason why it always seem to appear like the wallet buys the dip is because it coincides with people putting their bitcoin up as collateral, causing it to end up in the wallet. Then they proceed to buy bitcoin with their received loan pushing the price up."

2022-07-19,"If it isn’t a single entity or person, the trail probably somehow leads back to BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street Corporation or Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in some capacity. Pepsi, Coca-Cola, the packaged food industry, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft ALL lead back to 3 of these 4 institutional investors. Any company that builds computers, electronics, smart phones and household appliances you’ll find these (4) at the top. Matter of fact, pick ANY industry and you’ll find these (4) among the top 10 institutional investors. Look at every major publicly traded company in the world and you’ll often find BlacKRock as the 1st,2nd or 3rd largest investor.

2022-01-06,"To preface my reply to this thread, I’ll disclaim I work as a fixed-income researcher at an investment firm. 

It’s very reductive to say rates up -> equities down. This simply isn’t true empirically, even though the past 30 years have been a secular declining interest rate environment, there is no compelling evidence of a contemporaneous relationship between rates and equity return. Otherwise everyone would just be trading rates. 

The reason equity markets (tech) in particular have been responding negatively to the latest Fed minutes is the prospect that they might aggressively scale back Fed balance sheet, which will withdraw liquidity from the mkt. Now why tech has been hit particularly hard is because there’s this popular narrative that tech stocks = long duration assets. In a rising rate environment, long duration bonds/assets get crushed and we see rotation from growth stocks to value. 

I personally think this view that tech = long duration is a bit wishy-washy too. What’s the duration on tesla stock? It would be extremely sensitive to future cashflow growth rate projection/terminal value. In fact it could technically go to infinity if one assumes tesla can grow its cashflow faster than the discount rate…

Anyways, if you are interested in learning more about fixed income, the following concepts might be good starting point:

-basic bond math and time value of money, understand the inverse relationship between price and yield.

-duration and convexity

-term premium/credit premium

-shape of the yield curve and relation between spot/forward rate.

I might be personally biased, but compared to equities, bond returns are less “noisy” in the sense they are governed by cashflows, which makes the asset class more appealing to quantitatively-oriented folks. Contrary to what average people think, bonds are not boring vanilla instruments and could have very complex derivative structures embedded in them (think mortgage backed securities, CDOs etc), so the valuation can get very challenging.

Edit: I did not imagine this reply would get many thoughtful responses, so appreciate you all for taking the time to read through my drivel, will try best to respond to each reply."

2022-01-06,"Wow, what a fantastic write up! You say about midway that the shortest treasuries (which dictate what the risk-free rate is essentially) are treasury bills, but in the first section you called the shortest treasuries ""notes"". Was that a mix up or did I misunderstand something?"
2022-01-06,"This is really an excellent post. Thanks for taking the time.

One question for you: As you noted, the whole ""US Govt bonds have zero risk"" narrative is based on the assumption that the US is indeed capable of repaying its debts, and specifically, that's it's the single entity most capable of doing so in the entire world. Historically, that assumption has been justified. 

However, as a non-American looking from the outside, and leaving political allegiances out of it, it's possible to form the view that the US might be in for some turbulent times over the next few years as it grapples with certain internal issues, which might test its position as the *de facto* ""safest economy"" in the world. More relevantly for our purposes here, whatever underlying economic factors might or might not be in play, the sheer fact that people may think this could change the way investors, whether inside the US or outside, view the ""zero risk"" status of US-issued bonds.

So I guess my question is, to what extent do you think it's fair to expect this to play out along historical lines? Is there any reason to expect the see-saw relationship between the attractiveness of bonds and other investments to differ this time around? Obviously the existence of crypto as an asset class is new, so there's that, but I'm more thinking from the angle that there may be less intrinsic confidence in US-issued bonds, or at the very least an asterisk of sorts that there didn't used to be. Then again, habits are slow to change, so perhaps when things are really hitting the fan people will still choose the known path.

Anyway, thanks again.

If i understand correctly:

- X takes a loan from the US gov
- The gov later turns this particular loan into a bond
- FED buys the bond
- This means that X is effectively paying back the loan and interest to the FED.

If that is correct, who is X in most cases of bonds? (And as a bonus, why is this low risk? Couldn’t X default on the government bond also?)"
2022-01-06,"EVERYONE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THEY USA CAN NEVER RAISE INTEREST RATES:

Back in the late 1970's the US Govt did NOT lie about the inflation rate.  They calculated the CPI correctly.  Inflation was higher than today because did not lie.

Ronald Reagan, in the presidential debate 1979, asked the public... If you are happier today than you were before the high inflation, then I suggest you vote for Mondale (his opponent).  Biggest landslide in election history.

1980, Paul Volker, head of the Fed, took interest rates above 20%.  It was doable because the debt was only 300 billion.  It crushed business and the economy at first, but inflation was controlled.

Bottom line is... They would have to raise interest rates higher than the REAL inflation rate.  This is undoable because of the 30 trillion debt today.  We would hyperinflate just printing money to cover the interest.  Nobody understands this.. even the financial media."

2021-10-12,"Surprised no one has actually pointed out what JD is talking about here:

The point is that once halvings go down to zero, there will be no more block rewards and the income for those securing the network will be entirely due to fees. 

If there aren't enough fees to keep miners in business, then they leave the network and security falls, which is bad for everyone.

If this happens, the miners might just decide to fork bitcoin, remove that hard cap code, and continue block rewards. Because it could have the majority of miners/hashpower, the chain with >21 million BTC might actually be the more secure chain. 

No one can change the cap on the current chain, but remember, there are thousands of bitcoin forks and if consensus moves to one with no hard cap (ie it follows the block reward money), then there is no longer a hard cap. What you currently know as ""BTC"" is just the consensus fork."

>You all read the algorithms?

Oh cmon. No. Yes, you do. Many others do. I don't, I have better things to do with my time, validation.cpp alone is like 5k lines and unlike most other code I read and write, I don't get paid for this. Instead, I wait for community approval on any new coin. Trust through scrutiny. If we're talking open source and a few million people look at something and say ""this is good"", I'm inclined to trust the wisdom of the crowd. Of course, I also don't invest large sums.

I'd wager <= 1% of the people who trade or HODL cryptocurrencies  actually read the source code. I can't really give an estimate on reading whitepapers, but that's definitely not 100% either.

>I've always been a skeptic of stuff like that
>Stuff like what? reading?

Well, probably more a skeptic of the fact that this can't be changed. And yes, he probably didn't read the extremely simple function you posted a screenshot of. But long story short, that's a valid question for someone who hasn't read the entire source code of Bitcoin or any other coin. How is guaranteed, absolutely and finally, that those lines of code will never be changed? (You can actually provide me with an answer on this one, it's not just a rhetorical question, If you've read the entire Bitcoin source code, maybe you could just point me to relevant functions and the files they're in?)

>He also called Bitcoin worthless

This is inherently true. Let's look at this from an economics strandpoint, not a technical one. Bitcoin in of itself has no value. To be fair - neither does the dollar. Actually, the dollar's value comes from the fact that it's centralized and it's also legal tender in a major country, so it's relatively stable and you know if you accept dollars for your goods and services, their value won't change much. Bitcoin's value is all speculative. The entire value is based not on what you can do with it now, but on the fact that ""there will be a limited amount of it and more people will want it so it has to go up, so I'll buy it now"", so it really is pretty much a game of musical chairs with money. Except you can always buy back in again and might get luckier next time.

Something like Ethereum is better in this regard, it actually has extra use cases, while Bitcoin has fewer uses than the dollar. It's not used widely as a currency and if it was, it'd be very risky. Why pay for something in Bitcoin is the value could double over the next month? Why accept Bitcoin for something if the value could halve over the next month. Stablecoins are also technically better, because you can actually use those as a currency. But Bitcoin, in particular, is a big-ass game of musical chairs where both the prizes AND the losses are big. For you to gain money from investing in Bitcoin, someone else has to lose money, unless it keeps gaining value forever. But as we know, nothing goes straight up forever. 

TL;DR: It really depends on how you interpret Jamie's talking points. He's right in that most people don't really understand how Bitcoin work and still buy it. He's also right in that Bitcoin in particular is worthless. Not all too different from Beanie Babies, really. Apparently I'm not alone in thinking that either - just googling bitcoin and beanie babies in the same query gives you a bunch of results."

2021-08-22,"Can we just get rid of the mentality that every smart contract project aims to kill Ethereum? They each have their pros and cons. Each project has the potential to fill the gap of others.

I am actually envisioning that someday dApps and defi protocols will be available on multiple chains. The same way that an app has an android, ios, windows, or linux version."
2021-08-22,"Alright, I'll bite.

>Not only will Cardano's price dump tremendously on the day that their smart contracts ""release"" (let's see if they get delayed again), but not a single prominent and actively used dApp that actually has known, respected developers and hundreds of thousands of active users has committed to migrating from other chains to Cardano.

I'll refer you to [this link](https://github.com/input-output-hk/essential-cardano/blob/main/essential-cardano-list.md) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oBUiOLBrBg). The first link is to a fairly comprehensive outline of the Cardano ecosystem - everything from its partnerships to NFTs to oracles to DEXes and so on. It's massive. You may just find some familiar names in that list. The video is a clip of Charles himself talking about dapps on Ethereum and just how many of them are looking to migrate. The long and short of it is that all of the top 15 dapps on Ethereum have looked into migrating to another blockchain, and several are actively pursuing it. Also, only 31% of new dapps are deployed on Ethereum as opposed to other ecosystems. I think most people are tired of the high gas prices, and they are looking for an alternative. In my opinion, they're just waiting. They'll let others test the water then decide if they want to migrate or not afterwards.

&#x200B;

>Furthermore, none of the dApps that Cardano touts around in their ""ecosystem"" have working products or any hope of pulling developers or users from other networks. Who even uses anything that Cardano has in its ""ecosystem"" anyway? I'd love to know how many users and transactions occur on those dApps. Unless you see the likes of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, Synthetix, USDC, and Yearn talk about migrating to Cardano, there really isn't anything to talk about with regard to ""Cardano killing Ethereum"". Hint: they'll never migrate.

As you've pointed out, there are no dapps yet on the Cardano mainnet, so there are zero users and transactions as of yet. Can't argue that. However, there are a number of promising DEXes and liquidity providers (ErgoDEX, Liqwid, SundaeSwap, and others) that are building on the Alonzo testnet as we speak. They may not be the same names you mentioned, but they do have the support of the Cardano community, and there is a good deal of excitement surrounding them. In addition, there is a budding NFT ecosystem growing on Cardano.

&#x200B;

>I would be willing to bet that after a few months of smart contracts being live on Cardano, there will be scant activity on the network and Charles will be forced to bridge, and kneel to Ethereum, just like the rest of the ""Ethereum killers"" have.

There are already plans to bridge to (and from) the Ethereum network. One of the goals is cross-chain interoperability. There is an ERC-20 token converter in the works that will allow for easy migration to the Cardano blockchain, as well as a KEVM that will allow Solidity smart contracts to run on Cardano. In addition, projects like [occam.fi](https://occam.fi) are already building cross-chain liquidity protocols between Ethereum and Cardano.

&#x200B;

>While Cardano was sleeping during the bear market and selling off their holdings to their bagholders who they promised a ""world changing protocol"", the projects I listed above continued to develop real, functioning applications

I disagree that Cardano was sleeping during the bear market. The academic approach you have so quickly dismissed has allowed them to build an insanely robust and correct system from the ground up. Each step has been meticulously peer-reviewed and scrutinized. Much of this work was done during the bear market. Ethereum historically has taken a ""move fast, break things, we'll fix it later"" approach.. hence the move to PoS with ETH2. Cardano has done the opposite - build it once, build it right. There are pros and cons to each method, but at the end of the day, you have to ask yourself whether you want your financial system built quickly or built correctly.

For the record, Charles doesn't care much for the phrase ""Ethereum killer"", and neither do I. I think, as in all things, a balance will be found. Once people discover that smart contracts can run on Cardano faster and cheaper than on Ethereum, some will migrate, and some won't. The ones that do migrate will take some of the pressure off the Ethereum network and gas prices will fall.

I'm not entirely sure why you're so hateful towards Cardano (if you don't like it, don't use it), but I'll say that the blockchain space is big enough for everybody. Right now, at a time when governments across the world are seeking to embrace, regulate, or destroy crypto.. there is no room for tribalism amongst the larger crypto community. The world's eyes are on us, we don't need to be fucking it up by fighting amongst ourselves.

EDIT: Thank you all for the awards! There's a lot I didn't touch on - the Ethiopia deal (which has onboarded approximately a million users at last count), the Plutus Pioneers program (which I believe a number of Solidity devs have gone through), supply chain tracking (BeefChain, ScanTrust, etc), World Mobile, Ouroboros Omega (51% attack resistance/recovery), Atala PRISM, and so much more.

EDIT 2: RIP my inbox. Thank you all for the comments and awards! I want to add that I find it ironic that there are many of you defending the slow movement of ETH2 and suggesting that good work takes time, and so many of you bashing Cardano for the same reasons."
2021-08-22,"ETH is like Manhattan. Horribly crowded with insane traffic, but they're doing a ton of business. 

Cardano is like someone selling a potentially lucrative spot of land but absolutely no businesses are there yet. They promise that they'll finish the roads in a month or two but they'll be some damn amazing and scientifically proven roads. 

Most up and coming smart contract coins promise massive highways and roads but nobody knows if the roads and bridges are really safe to drive on and only hydrogen powered vehicles approved by them are allowed on the roads."

2021-08-22,"Hi, I'm not saying this is just another rant or just another ""Cardano is overhyped post"" ... But yes.. It sounds more like a well studied rant. Let me explain why I think that -

Every community have Maxis, that doesn't make Charles fraud or something..
Charles never said go buy Ada, he never said we'll quickly provide solution to all the problems, he said it would take time, that doesn't mean a project is a scam. I mean come on! Ethereum is a scam in the eyes of Bitcoin Maxis.
Why do you think no one will use Cardano? At one point eth used to be the same, in development, without smart contact, or ""famous"" smart contracts, your argument sound more like a Bitcoin maxi rant from few years back arguing about ""Why eth is scam"".
Many other projects are doing great yes! And still eth is preferred even with all that blotted network, do we call eth hyped? No... A $50 transfer asks for $30 in fees, and when this is mentioned, eth lovers will says ""this is what you py for future technology in early stage"" but the issue is there right, saying this is like having faith.. That eth2.0 is ""Going to solve all the problems"".. But it is not here yet, but you still believe it, based on your understanding of the project, the same way people believe that when Smart Contracts are there on Cardano, it can be amazing, is it bad to think that? 
When buying Coins n tokens people can choose sides.. But when it comes to paying for transactions, people want cheapest option available, if Cardano or any other project provide that along with security, scalability don't you think people wants to use it?
Charles never said he wants to kill eth or something. We all are hoping for a interoperability future.

Btw eth also fell bad in 2017 even with all the smart contracts etc, and it fell from high in may to $1600 this june.. That doesn't mean people have discarded eth. Same way $1 to $0.03 for a project that yet to deliver smart contract is fair... You also needs to understand the way Stock market works too. Many companies with promising future but yet to deliver are also bought for high, takes time to mature, capture market, bearing losses and then they rise. And when that happens, all the investment is paid off. It's a long game.
Nokia was once a leader in Mobiles, that doesn't mean people didn't migrated to Android from Symbian.
I know you might say Windows mobile failed.. But in Crypto we are still way early. ✌🏻"

2021-08-22,Ill bet that 80% of people that come across your post wont even read it and most of the comments will barely reflect the discussion you look to exchange in.
2021-08-22,"Where does this ETH killer argument come from? Because certainly neither Cardano nor Charles Hoskinson promote it as an ETH killer. It's an alternative yes, but if you ever watched an interview with CH, he does have this view, that the future will be multi-blockchain. Each Blockchain fulfilling a certain aspect, it's best at. 

Ethereum and Cardano aren't even competitors in many regards, as they aim for different markets. 

Ethereum isn't going to African countries, like Ethiopia, with the offer to give an identity solution to farmers, in order to reduce fraud with handed out government aid."

Hard to be a bag holder when it’s at ATH isn’t it? There is a lot of hype and a lot to still be actually done, agreed there. ETH is the clear favorite which is currently reflected in value. You make good points but parts of your rant including the highlighted area are… a bit much."
2021-08-22,If Ada hits 0.05 again I'm gonna buy shitloads
2021-08-22,"Most people will likely be focused on the price action and that’s unfortunate. 

However, I think your argument fails to realize that Ethereum, while having proved the functionality of dApps, have also taken quite a long time to implement changes like the hard fork and Eth 2.0 (since 2015). 

Keep in mind, I do think Cardano can be way overhyped at times and it is way over valued. But many projects are waiting to get in after smart contract release including the Orion network which will bring lots of activity using smart contracts.

Yes they have delayed several times but they have made plenty of progress

EDIT: I made this post while drinking wine so I feel I didn’t do it justice u/graph_marine lol.

I’ll address your first point: Cardano needing to build cross chain bridges.

If you look at their Whiteboard explanation for what Cardano is (https://youtu.be/Ja9D0kpksxw) you’ll see that interoperability was part of the road map from the very beginning. Charles along with the team believe that interoperability with other chains is important. There is no such thing as a “one size fits all” blockchain because not all blockchains can fulfill every need a developer has.

I’ll give one example. You as a developer have a decentralized social media app you want to deploy. You want to deploy on top of a blockchain that can handle 10 million + people slamming the network all at once when Justin Bieber tweets “album coming soon.” But you also want a blockchain that is secure because we don’t want the content on the  app getting lost or people’s accounts getting hacked right?

So, you might choose Solana to scale to millions and billions of users and you might choose Cardano for top notch security or vice versa (I would argue that Cardano can handle both with their hydra protocol for networks storage and their strong network of nodes delivering robust security through decentralization). Charles mentions that the best apps are Mercenary and the above mentioned points are some of what makes an app mercenary-like.

All this is to say that Cardano is not building bridges to ethereum because they risk being irrelevant. Rather, they are building interoperability because the future will be multi-chain.

Hope this does your point justice OP."
2021-08-22,"Lol never in the discussion, last time i checked eth was moving to PoS because its gas fees are useless for it to be used as a medium of transfer and not other way around."
2021-08-22,At the end of the day. If we were to listen to others opinion I would never make any money. Nobody knows what will happen next. You can make as many educated guess as you please.

My opinion use some common sense and follow your own instincts!
2021-08-22,"“Have you ever actually used a decentralized exchange, lending protocol, NFT marketplace/game, or provided liquidity to these networks?”

Most will answer no because it costs more in gas to make this transaction than the transaction actually nets them. So that’s the problem.

Also, this whole post is just cringe. 95% of the community is aboard the train of “let opposing ecosystem coexist.” Then we have the small minority like you that is the loudest that makes it seem like it’s a fierce competition. We want several smart contract ecosystems to thrive. So fuck off with this tribalism. You’re falling for silly Twitter and Reddit bullshit that you accuse others of in your post."

2022-02-01,"> Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said 30% tax would charged on income from transfer of virtual digital assets.

The way I read this, on every sale, 30% of the transaction amount goes to the govt and the seller only keeps 70%, right? So this is not just on gains. If you sell at a loss also, you pay 30% tax.

This is tax on income not tax on profit.

Say you buy 300 Rs. of crypto and next day it crashes to 200, you decide to sell and get out, you pay 60 Rs. tax when you sell? So you end up with 140 Rs.

Edit: while the above was based on my interpretation of the statement, few experts have weighed in over the last couple of hours in Indian news media and the consensus seems to be that it will only be tax on gains and passive income, so no need to pay tax on loss making transactions.

Who ever came up with this lie is an absolute moron, because any true Cardano member who pays attention to the development understands the PAB is necessary for developers to launch Dapps efficiently, but not immediately. While Alonzo provided the infrastructure necessary to support smart contracts, launching them is another story and the PAB only recently got deployed on the testnet.

Those without tempered expectations drove the narrative and were unfortunately the loud ass minority who always come here in hopes to pump up the price and then vanish or FUD when the price is stagnant or down.

It's the obvious example of why people need not pay attention to the price so much, because this is all that results is an interest to pump or dump the project rather than understand the work that's actually being done...

2022-01-22,"The volatility is why it will never become a truly adopted currency, at least not until it settles down. Imagine being a car dealer taking BTC and you sell that $42k car a few days ago for 1 BTC. Now what? All your profit on the vehicle is gone, you’re probably underwater on what YOU paid for the car as the dealer, and unless you sold the BTC the second you got it, you now stand the risk of losing even more. While it’s fine for us plebs to say “hodl until Valhalla” (and I personally do), unless you believe every business should become a mini investment fund, that’s a recipe for failure."

A group of whitehat hackers discovered a vulnerability in the Polygon PoS genesis contract on December 3. Polygon paid a total of $3.46 million as bounty to two white hats who helped discover the bug.

I like Brian, he's a hero in a way, but in my own opinion, I don't like Stable coins. I don't understand the point of them when they are backed by an actual physical asset.  Look at tether. Stable coins that are algorithmically stable and backed by a crypto, I like this much more. And as scary as the idea of a CBDC is, this is better than a stable coin like tether.

From what I noticed: Left - CBDC's and bridge currencies Right: stable coins backed by physical USD to keep the USD as a reserve currency longer.

I'm probably wrong here.  But I'd like to also add that KYC addresses are stupid, it's not like it's impossible to follow addresses. It's not even necessary. If they want to follow someone's address and see what they're doing on the ledger it's already very possible."

2022-01-22,"I’ll probably get downvoted for this, but this analysis is missing the forest for the trees. Pretty much every data point from 2018-2019 here is showing the same crash/winter when we went from $20k down to $3k over the course of a year or so. It fits your criteria, but the criteria isn’t very indicative of the boom and bust cycle we’ve seen up to this point. Nobody knows what’s going to happen next, but I certainly wouldn’t rush into a trade right now based on this analysis thinking you’ll recover all your money in ~5 months."
2022-01-22,"So I should buy in 4.9 months. Got it! 

/s"
2022-01-22,"One thing you didn't incorporate into your analysis is that the entire lifetime of bitcoin has played out in the biggest bull market of our lifetime. 

We have no data for bitcoin bear markets that represent times of global economic downturns. And it's exactly an  economic downturn that's expected to occur for the upcoming years. If BTC drops 65% and takes 2 years to recover in a historic bull market, imagine how much it drops and how long it takes to recover in a historic bear market.

And now that you've imagined this, ask yourself the following: will the upcoming economic climate to come in the next few years be more of what we've already had these previous 12 years, or will it be more representative of the times we've had post 2000 or post 2008?

Nobody knows the answer to this, but it would be foolish to assume BTC will recover as easily and to close our eyes to the possibility of other scenario's."
2022-01-22,Also wanna throw in there - lots of long recoveries from 2018. Since then recoveries have tended to be much faster. Not saying much with so little historical data but an interesting trend

Everytime you buy a coin consider it a 5 year contract. Where will this coin be in 5 years? Probably up. If you do t have that kind of confidence in your coin, then dont buy it.

2022-01-22,"The cool thing about buying at ATH is you get to ""catch falling knives"" all the way down which lowers your cost basis. If you can hodl strong and stay committed to collecting as many knives as you can, regardless of the scars you'll receive (loss in value of your investment), eventually it will turn around and rocket to new ATH's leaving you with a vast collection of knives that are far more valuable than when you caught them.

I jumped in around 13k back in late 2017, bought more at 15k, 18k, 12k, 8k, 6k, 4k, and clear back up to 55k and didn't sell a dime until we hit 57k early last year. Still hodling the majority and starting to accumulate again. You have to be consistent, patient, and emotionless when investing or you're going to get burnt."

Couple of questions from me:

1. I seen an article from PWC the other day regarding a new maritime decarbonization centre in Singapore - Will Vechain have any involvement in this project?
2. I see LVMH have decide to develop the AURA Blockchain, can you give any insight into why they've taken this decision (instead of using VeChain) . Will this effect any current or future partnerships/collaborations with LVMH going forwards?

Thanks for you time and keep up the great work!"

That's what happens in a deflationary economy.

2021-07-16,"Just keep in mind that Bitcoin’s inflation rate is currently 1.8% due to the new btc being minted.  Don’t confuse its price action with its inflation rate.

If your native currency is the peso and you invested in the dollar, you’d see the dollar appreciate rapidly next to the peso.  That isn’t deflation of the dollar, That’s price action between two currencies.

Inflation is relative to the currency itself, not how it exchanges with other currencies.  At present, bitcoin is minting 1.8% annually. In three years that’ll go down by half… and eventually, when the supply is 21 million, the inflation rate will go to 0."

2021-07-16,"Bitcoin has other issues. With a finite number it will need to be severely fractionalized over time and inflation will still happen.

In order for SHIB to go to a dollar in our lifetimes, the US dollar (and all fiat currency for that matter) would have to depreciate so harshly that the entire economic system and world collapses. Cash is worthless. It starts with looting and rioting in the streets and that eventually turns into total anarchy everywhere. Real-life purge on a worldwide level.

The world's currency becomes nuclear weapons and we end up blowing ourselves up. I don't think this is hyperbole: our planet turns to dust before SHIB hits a dollar."

2022-02-15,"I dislike robinhood but I currently use them for recurring purchases. If someone has an alternate exchange that doesn’t include a transaction fee that’d be nice. Currently I’m investing $6/day into BTC and ETH with the goal that once it becomes enough, I’ll move it over to Coinbase. I truly don’t trust Robinhood, as they have gotten their hands dirty with trading in the past, it just isn’t really logical to me to use recurring purchases through an exchange with a $1 fee (or more)…that would mean 1/7 of my investment is purely fees, which is certainly not a good ratio."

2021-04-03,"Both are bad. The only odd part is when people criticize one while conveniently ignoring the problems with the other.

> The utility of the exchanges made possible by Bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used.

The utility for the **person mining** is greater than the cost of mining. The utility may be, and likely is, less than the total cost.

That's the nature of externalized costs. The real costs are paid by someone else. Often the costs are only suffered in the future, and are distributed widely so as to be unnoticeable to the individual.

That's the case with bitcoin. The miner pays only money for equipment and electricity. Same thing with gold. The end user of gold pays only money. But for both the cost to the environment is paid by everyone and is paid in blood.

And don't get me wrong, this isn't sufficient reason to abandon bitcoin entirely right now. But it is reason we should be working towards alternatives that aren't as costly."
2021-04-03,"once again reddit proves how stupid it is

https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption

mining for gold is neglegable compared to the ""mining"" of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. sure, POS (proof of staking) exists, this is WHY it exists. stop doing shitty comparisons and instead show real solutions like POS. ""x is worse than z so I don't have to stop z!!!"" is a shitty argument anyways even if it were true."
2021-04-03,"This is not a good comparison. Bitcoin mining is really only the same as actual mining in the sense that it produces new coins. Really, BTC mining is processing transactions. The energy efficiency comparison than has to be to other processing types such as credit card, bank transfers, etc... also, actual gold mining isn’t done by millions of people thousands of times a second.

If people used BTC as an actual currency, the energy requirement would be greater than the entire planet produces right now. It’s irresponsible to downplay that issue by pointing out high energy use cases in completely different industries just because somebody calls it “digital gold”."
2021-04-03,That's just whataboutism not excusing the ridiculous amount of energy wasted by BTC. From an environmental perspective every business has to contribute it's best to turn things to the better...
2021-04-03,Aside from the energy use people die in precious metals/gem mines all the time
2021-04-03,"No. It’s a real concern and I think people are right to bring it up, it’s just unreasonable to single that out as the reason to not use it without discussing renewable energy alternatives, access to digital gold being a social justice issue, and the existence of other chains which provide services at a much lower energy cost. I don’t think we should ignore environmental impact, just we shouldn’t expect to grind to a halt as soon as the issue comes up."

2021-04-03,It's both bad mkay
2021-04-03,"Newly mined gold is used more in electronics than it is used as a medium of exchange. It's a big issue right now because we are running out of easily accessible gold for electronics, most of the gold is tied up in jewelry, bullion, and e-waste. Seems a little ironic to dismiss criticism of BTC mining energy usage by saying gold mining is also wasteful, when the gold is needed to make the computer components to mine BTC."
2021-04-03,"Being a more efficient alternative does not make it a good alternative. Theres no need to use the electricity of medium sized countries just to send value around the internet. Youre making an arguement of the lesser of two evils when there are far more efficient ways of value transfer and pretending like since btc isnt as harmful as gold mining, that theres nothing bad or wrong with its lack of efficiency."
2021-04-03,Difference is that bitcoin doesn't have to be energy inefficient. It's designed to be so on purpose.
2021-04-03,The real shame is that BTC's throughput has been restricted. So much hash for only 7tx/s is indeed a waste.
2021-04-03,"There is utility in gold as material that cannot be replaced, e.g in science and technology. Granted, is a low amount to what is being minted, but still. 

Same goes for TV, it is fulfilling several purposes. 

What purpose does btc have that cannot can be replaced by more energy efficient coins?"
2021-04-03,But does that fact make Bitcoin any better in comparison? No it’s a red herring
2021-04-03,"A lot of mining is also required for renewable energies so whatever the source of energy is, it's always harmful to the environment. Renewable energies require a lot of rare earth elements both in power plants and batteries. The best technology is energy efficient.

It's also nice physically having a thing thats worth something.

Even if the other avenues don't bring the same returns as crypto, which they almost certainly won't, it's worth it for the piece of mind knowing that you won't be completely fucked if crypto goes south.

Lmao what? What's with the recent victim complex? Your take isn't even that ""Hot"" lmao."
2021-05-25,"This is...sort of correct?  

If you are going for overall portfolio diversification, then you need diversification between asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash, crypto, etc.), as well as diversification *within* asset classes.

Stocks are an easy example.  While MSFT and GME are both stocks, one is obviously more stable than the other -- indeed, MSFT has a beta of .79, so it's less volatile than investing in an S&P 500 index fund.  GME, on the other hand, has a beta (5y monthly) of -1.94, which becomes a fascinating number when you look at what has happened over the last 5 months.  Nobody in their right mind would say that investing in MSFT and GME is the same thing.

More to the point, if you want to have diversification within an asset class, you have to look at how two positions relate to each other.  The fancy term for this is ""covariance.""  You also need to look at their correlation to determine how strong the relationship is.  For sake of argument, if the covariance = 1 and the correlation = 1, then you actually don't have any diversification at all -- if ABC moves one way, XYZ moves in the exact same direction.

The amount of legwork that goes into the above is why just about everyone seeking diversification should just buy index funds for small, medium, and large cap companies.  

The crypto space is the same way.  To the extent that coins move together, owning multiple coins won't give you true diversification.  But from what few charts I've reviewed, the correlation between BTC and other coins isn't that great.  Yes, there are overall market movements, but that is a bit different from what we are talking about.  If someone owns 10 coins, given the volatility of each coin, you're pretty well diversified for this asset class."

Bitcoin, and crypto in general, are actually extremely illiquid compared to the traditional markets, like where AMC and GME trade... every single dollar that is put into crypto, is represented by more than $20 of market cap. A lot of newer people simply do not understand this concept.

Due to this, and the amount of leverage utilized in the space, it is incredibly easy to move prices with an amount of capital that is a mere fraction of what is reflected by market caps and on exchanges. This, combined with the amount of bots that do most of the trading, can cause mass sell-offs and flash crashes on exchanges.

I'm not tin hatting and saying all of the last few weeks was caused by manipulators... but there are literal provable cases of coordinated FUD from the Chinese, and your description of things shows your understanding of this space is fundamentally lacking."

DOGE is the rite of passage for crypto at this point, but all in all- this is the adoption the community asked for; and this is the growth we wanted. It's inevitable that the entry point for crypto would be something simple. DOGE was it. 

Anyway...

2021-04-21,"I used coinbase to invest a small amount in ETH just cause - but had no idea how to move crypto around. Got washed up in the dogecoin hype so I had to do a lot of research and learned how to get my own wallet (since it's not listed on coinbase) - ended up not only buying some doge (for fun), but vechain and chainlink.  Which ended up in $15K of total crypto - and planning to allocate even more savings / investments in the near future.  

I see doge as just a lottery ticket, if it burns, it burns - but it opened my eyes to a lot more that I'll take seriously."
2021-04-21,I missed the Doge... But i scooped up ankr! Sitting on that for 10/15 might let me retire early hahaha

Some reasons are more pragmatic, some are greedy, some are odd, some are humanistic and more.

The thing is that if cryptos can support a need or want or usefulness in many different enforcements of life for several reasons it's good for everyone.

With monthly salary of that amount, the ones who often transacted with bitcoin is not an average joe.

2021-06-02,"I saw arguments for crypto currencies but none for bitcoin. I'm unconvinced that bitcoin with slow transactions and stupidly high fees and volatility is of actual practical use to oppressed people where their weekly wage probably wouldn't pay the transaction fee, not to mention the lack of internet access and education posing barriers to its adoption. How do you buy your bread with that transfer fee and when the bread might be double or half the price day to day? 

Was there actually any sourced claims in that video about it's day to day use in underdeveloped countries? The only sourced claims I could see were for moving wealth in or out of the country. I.e. Wealthy people who can afford the fees engaging in foreign interference or sending money to family members who use it to flee the country. 
It seemed like the video pushed that bitcoin will liberate impoverished countries when the sources provided just seem to affirm its existing use for foreign interference and wealth flight. The people who need liberating aren't being liberated by bitcoin. 

These people don't need bitcoin, they barely even need cryptos more broadly. Bitcoin won't repair a broken/underdeveloped economy or repair a dysfunctional government, arguably it may worsen things by providing escape routes for the wealthy to avoid taxation that's needed for vital services. 

I think crypto currencies have potential but I think the claims of bitcoins utility to oppressed people in this video are way way overstated."
2021-06-02,"Most of the coins are owned by wealthy people in wealthy countries though, and it's kinda inherent to the crypto game that early adopters profit the most. If anything Bitcoin punishes late adopters more than other coins because it has supply inflation that goes to literally 0%."

Do you even understand Bitcoin?



Bitcoin is not a currency, it is a wealth commodity to transfer larger amounts of value between entities. It has a transaction rate of ten minutes if you get in the next block. No one is going to buy a soda and wait around for 10-20 minutes for the transaction to clear. 




Fuck for all, people need to start learning about what various coins/tokens do and why they do it. This business of paying any attention to shit coins only hurts everyone in the long run. It about time to get serious about crypto, I understand lots of people made bank on shit coins, but we really need to start supporting coins with legitimate value."

2021-07-08,Crypto has gone in a different direction since I got in back in 2017. Back then it was all about trying to improve payment systems and being able to put money into something that is deflationary. Now we're in a phase where people want to earn interest on their crypto and if the coin can't be staked it's doomed. DEFI and NFT's are what's hot right now.
2021-07-08,"That's the reality of the market.

Your product can be as good as it is, but if there is no market interest, it won't be worth anything"

2021-07-08,Let them rebrand as Nano dog and they will be back in top 100 in no time
2021-07-08,This isn’t the first time it has happened - the fundamentals of the coin are still the same. The top100 is filled with absolute garbage. The devs need to fully resolve the spam situation and then market the project if they hope for it to be a success. I still hold some because I like the project - it’s so much easier to use than BTC imo

2021-07-08,"I like Nano and it feels bad to see it falling out of the top 100, but that's just how the market goes. I've said many times that people in this sub only ""do their research"" and invest on things they like to see in a coin, not what the market likes/demands, that's why so many people still don't understand how Doge is up there.

That said, I'm sure Nano will come back and be important, as long as the team behind it are able to see the weaknesses of the coin as a product."

The problem with NANO is that its *too* perfect. There's nothing to gain from it, and so there's no one to motor its adoption.  
There's no rent seeking stackers to generate hype, no DEFI farming scheme, no miners, no fees... It sounds ideal, but in a paradoxical way it's not. You need these parasites to kickstart adoption.  
And yet, I hope for a miracle that it still somehow succeeds.

2021-03-23,"I had this viewpoint the first bull run. Holding is one of the best ways to make money in crypto. But you have to make sure you’re invested in a project that actually has potential long term and not just a shitcoin.


Ie Verge in 2017 hit an ATH of like 20+ cents and has never been close to hitting that price. If you held onto it from an ATH to now, you would not be sitting pretty. So it’s good to sell and take profits sometimes, especially if you’ve 5x’d + your money.  Remember this is a bull run you are in, you’ll have to wait another 4 years to take profits after this one ends because gains like this don’t happen every year."

2021-03-23,"Ahh. This sentiment will be replaced with ""I wish I sold my Shitcoins"" like every single other boom.  You need to know when to take profit.

Buy back in when it crashes next.  FOMO will keep you clinging to 'but what if it goes to a gajillion dollars per coin?' or worse, you'll take profit, then FOMO back in during a bull trap.

We've seen this all before. People talking of riches, how happy they are, but so many haven't taken profit.  Just know that this goes south very, very fast.  Like my father said of crypto (he made heaps last boom) ""you can literally go to the bathroom, take a dump and be broke by the time you come out"".  That's the reality.

Live your life, take profit.   Even if you sold last month and only made 10x on a coin - you still won.  Sell next month and potentially  lose 80%.. who knows.

  There's a reason we start sharing the suicide hotline after every boom.  Be clever, and be kind to yourself."
2021-03-23,"Interesting point.  My stance is long term.  I’m blessed right now where I can spend 2k and not care.  Win or lose.   If I check back in a year and my wallet is big?  Awesome.  If not, who cares.   Sir, this is the biggest casino on Earth."

In my opinion bullish news happen every day, but they have very different results depending on the overall sentiment of the market."

2. Both Baby Doge and Dogecoin pumped when he tweeted

2021-07-01,"He's always had good timing for his tweets, and he was only ever relevant because boomercoin has so many fidgity paperhands.  

Also the irrelevance bumped the price of DogeCoin by two cents this morning before a bunch of people sold it back down to the median (wise move).   On top of that Bitcoin is down by 1k and that usually drags down the price of alts. 

A few takeaways; 

1) CryptoJournalism is doubleshit.  Most of these ""breaking news"" sources are straight up propaganda outlets for big holding interests.  Cointelegraph is Barry Silbert's fucking blog. 

2) I feel like the only guy who looks at charts anymore.  Does nobody see the correlation between Bitcoin and the alts?  99% of all moves aren't even worth reporting on individual coins/tokens."
2021-07-01,You have to see posts about how irrelevant he is otherwise people will still think he's relevant. So we just gotta remind people that he is irrelevant and that's a good thing. Unless you're a sheep and you still idolize billionaires 🐑🥴

2021-07-01,"Did you try, you know, not posting about him?"
2021-07-01,To be fair this probably more of a Baby Dogecoin pump attempt than a dogecoing pump. Baby doge went up 100% after he tweeted that.
2021-07-01,His tweet was not an attempt to spike dogecoin... babydoge though.....
2021-07-01,"Why are people pretending like it's not a doge pump? Yes, it's a baby doge pump as well.

But 99% of the public has no idea what baby doge is/where to buy it, so they, like most people here, took it to be dogecoin.

And also I don't think it's just that we're not in a bull market anymore that his tweet didn't pump. I legit think his tweets are losing value at this point. Check the top comments on Twitter, they're all bashing him and calling him out.
Compared to months ago when they would all get hyped and spam doge memes in the comments."

2021-03-04,"Truth is, as crypto becomes more mainstream, it puts more pressure on exchanges being more secure.

Nothing is safe from a hack. Banks, government websites, crypto exchanges all have been hacked.

With every hack, more gets learned and evolves. If binance was to suddenly have millions of dollars stolen, as proven in the past, they reimburse their customers. Eventually the exchanges will have the same safety regulations and protocols as banks where they will be under legal obligation to protect their customers. 

Reputable exchanges are getting safer every year, to make sure they keep up with the public demand and keep a good image to the public"
2021-03-04,I would have disagreed with you but i live in a 3rd world country. Exchange fee for 1 bitcoin transaction at an exchange is equal to 3 days income
2021-03-04,"This is exactly the scenario the big blockers/bitcoin cashers warned about.

Small blockers claimed small blocks increase decentralization because more people can run full nodes, but have gotten the cost/benefit so out of wack in favor of high fees, that the fees create centralization pressure by incentivizing people to not even take their coins off the exchange at all."
2021-03-04,"I agree. Although exchanges are never fully safe from hacks, the big guys will be doing everything they can to keep yr funds safe. Any loss of customer funds is going to have a *huge* negative impact on their business.

An example of this is what happened to [Binance in 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-08/crypto-exchange-giant-binance-reports-a-hack-of-7-000-bitcoin) - $40 million stolen but they have an emergency fund for such situations and made sure none of their customers lost a dime. A lot of people don’t like Binance for various reasons but  I bring them up specifically to show that even the controversial exchanges will do whatever they can to retain customers and their image as a safe place to deal in crypto.

If yr dealing with some small, backwater, non-KYC exchange though, I’d be a bit more cautious."
2021-03-04,"Agreed, but get ready to get downvoted to oblivion."
2021-03-04,"This is a good point. The problem is how do I, or anyone else, determine when the amount of money being withdrawn is large enough that they/I should disregard the associated fees? For example, Tommy gets charged 0.0004 BTC on a 3k USD withdrawal. Where do you draw the line? It’s a bit of a grey area..."
2021-03-04,"The fees are definitely killer when it comes to withdrawal to a wallet you control. If you're working with small amounts this makes sense.

That's mainly why I love Gemini so much, just because of the 10 free withdrawals per month."
2021-03-04,"I understand where you're coming from, but my story is this: I held a lot of crypto and funds in what was, at one time, the largest exchange. That exchange ended up stealing everything from my account before being raided and shutting down.

On the other hand - I had about 6 wallets from the 2013/2014 era, and after a few days of work, I was able to restore all their coins and consolidated them into more modern storage.

YMMV."

and as long as they can do that.. an exchange is the least secure place to store your long term fortune . that is my opinion.   


for me : the most secure place to store my crypto  is one I control, and i  can access whenever I want without depending on anyone but me."
2021-03-04,"This is quite an interesting topic.

The thing is, even if centralized exchanges have become more secure, there is still the security concern that they can get hacked.

In my opinion [nash.io](https://nash.io) has one of the most powerful solutions, if your holdings are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Chainlink, NOIA, NEO, ...

Why?   
They built a Layer 2 network based on state channels. This is the kind of technology lightning network is using to try to scale bitcoin. The cool thing they can built different things on their Layer 2. Currently the built product on Layer 2 is an exchange, which connects Bitcoin, Ethereum and NEO without wrapping tokens.

The security of the Layer 2 network is based on blockchains they use. To get into the Layer 2 there you call a smart contract (Ethereum, NEO) or an HTLC (Bitcoin). This means there is no centralized point where nash controls your funds. For any action on the Layer 2 network your keys are used and you are always in control of your keys, if you interact with them. 

If you want to hold your coins I would highly recommend their Layer 2 network. You can hold your coins their in a secure environment and easily can switch into a stable coin to avoid volatility or any other price movements you want to avoid.

For Europe there is also an integrated 0% Fiat on/off ramp on their Layer 2, if you'd like to hop into Fiat, which is instant.

What are disadvantages?  
The thing is, if you hold your coins in their Layer 2, you can't interact with the Layer 1 blockchains. If you want to use Uniswap for example, you first need to transfer your Coins out of their Layer 2 (pay transaction fees) and then interact with Uniswap, which again causes transaction fees.

Transaction fees to get into their Layer 2 or get out of their Layer 2 are more expensive than simple transactions on the blockchain networks. You should keep that in mind."

2021-02-13,"The fact that this is even getting posted in this sub is proof that we are at the ""greed"" stage of the cycle."
2021-02-13,"I couldn't get my kids interested in crypto.  Last Sunday I had them all download a wallet and transferred them $600 of ADA, ALGO and XTZ.  Today they all have $960 and are suddenly very interested in crypto.

I'm 52."
2021-02-13,"Fuck my FIL beat me into the market.  He bought BTC at 10k last year and look at him now.

If you are astute and pay attention to things, age does not matter.

Here I am now buying at ATH and setting up mining rigs to run on my solar when the sun is up."
2021-02-13,"Y’all are missing the point. It’s not about mom “being old” it’s about parents/friends/etc reading about BTC on CNN and giving people advice who are already plugged into the game. 

This is a rehash of Buffets ol shoeshiner wisdom."
2021-02-13,"Mr(s). xrpsuckz has a point and I agree. They didn’t say that older people can’t be into crypto. Not that they can’t offer sound advice or be into crypto. Only that when your typical “mom” is making suggestions, it’s time to get out. I wholeheartedly agree."
2021-02-13,How about u get dark mode man burned my eyes
2021-02-13,"My 70 year old Dad still swears that crypto is stupid and that he will never hold any. I have to remind him that he signed up for coinbase so I could get that XLM learn drop bonus, so he does in-fact hold crypto. The ball is now in his court.

2021-01-19,"It's only going to keep going up as more and more people lock ETH up in staking.  Once sites like Coinbase and Binance offer pooled staking that is easy enough for casual holders to jump in on, it's going to skyrocket.  Decreasing the available supply for a year or more, all while offering an incentive by guaranteed dividends, essentially?  Yes please.

EDIT: A user below mentioned that binance.com already does one-click staking with ETH, which I didn't know.

2021-01-19,"The price of Ethereum has increased 15% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap, to hit as high as $1,414. That's above Ethereum's all-time high of $1,396, according to the data site.

Trading volumes have been growing rapidly too. More than $37 billion in Ethereum has been traded in the last 24 hours, as traders rush to get in on the action. The growing price has pushed Ethereum's market cap up. It now weighs in at $159 billion—that's around 23% of Bitcoin's market cap size."
2021-01-19,I am really grateful for eth breaking its ath. I will buy it after it corrects again
2021-01-19,"$1,400 wasn't the ATH, once we hit $1,500 later it'll be 100% confirmed new ATH though"

2021-11-23,Wasn’t the KuCoin CEO just on here a few weeks ago? Has anyone tried tagging him to get his response?
2021-11-23,I suggest you Lawyer up. They'd rather pay you than hassle themselves in court.
2021-11-23,I hope you're able to get that money back my friend. :^/
2021-11-23,"Yeah fuck kucoin. They almost stole my funds after 2 weeks of complaining that I didn't receive my deposit. If you go to the kucoin subreddit there are threads-a-plenty of users like me having their funds held hostage.

The customer service takes days to respond. It's actually faster to get something done complaining publicly on Reddit than dealing with their inhouse ticket system."
2021-11-23,"I've gone and withdrawn all of my crypto from KuCoin (only about $10,000 worth, but fuck them) and won't be using them again. This shit is absolutely shameful, but it coincides with bullshit they've pulled before, including intentionally turning off the ability to sell, letting servers go down, and various acts of price manipulation.

This is just the icing on the cake. I'm sure Gate or Kraken would love my business, so I'll be going there. 

I really hope you're able to withdraw your crypto, man. This shit is just flat out wrong.

I'm sharing this post on the KuCoin telegram to make as many people aware as possible."

2021-11-23,"TL;dr OP was fucked by an exchange. To all you people who think storing things in exchanges is as good or better than a bank, just wait until this happens to you 👍. 

Sorry to hear that though OP. I recommend publicly blasting them on Twitter and any other social media. Companies are more respondent when they could potentially lose 500k of other peoples money for the cost of your 50k."

2021-11-23,"Their support is really terrible. Once I deposited some $ONE coin but even after a week later it wasn’t credited to my account. I emailed them, tweeted about it and finally posted here but every time I got a generalized auto reply. Luckily after 14 days my missing ONE credited to my account. Binance live support and FTX support is far far better than KuCoin.

2021-04-02,"The thing is that he didn't actually get paid in Bitcoin.  He got paid from the team in regular dollars but worked out a deal with the team to divert half of his paychecks to a service that used that money to buy Bitcoin on his behalf. The arrangement is not much different than investing half of his paycheck.  Okung reportedly advocated to get paid in Bitcoin, but this was the best he could get so far."
2021-04-02,"Nba Top Shot showed , there is a huge opportunity for the teams and players in blockchain. 

He was very smart to get half of his salary in Bitcoin. Most probably the team paid the exchange fees also."
2021-04-02,"I'm confused. If he is getting weekly/biweekly/monthly checks? did they buy half his salaries worth of bitcoin first then decided to spread it out over the paychecks? 

He said he wanted half his $13 million dollar salary in bitcoin. Lets say he gets paid monthly. So $13 million divided by 2 is $6.5 mill. 6.5 million divided by 12 is 541,666. So he should be getting $541,666 worth of bitcoin a month. 

So lets say if bitcoin was at $20k when his contract was signed and he gets paid monthly. Would the NFL need to buy $6.5 million worth in bitcoin first then divide that amount by 12 and thats how much bitcoin he would get monthly?

Or, is he just owed $541,666 worth of bitcoin every month at whatever the price of bitcoin is the day before he gets paid?"

Like, they didn’t agree to pay him one million dollars plus 20 BTC per year (for example). Or did they?? Because if they did, that would amount to an annual increase of 50% or more, depending on the price. If he’s being paid out bitcoin over time, I hope the team bought it all at once. LOL"

When the price hit $30k it sparked a memory of my old bitcoin wallet. All I needed to do was find the bitcoin wallet info that I kept in a draft on my old Hotmail account and I would be over $300k richer. I was so excited, I've always been pretty poor and it seemed like my luck was finally changing. 

Except it wasn't. I opened the inbox expecting to find years of unread emails but it was completely empty. No inbox, no spam and no drafts. It turned out that at some point Hotmail had completely cleared the accounts of any users that hadn't logged for years. Somewhere there is a bitcoin wallet with 15 bitcoin in it and it's going to be stuck in there forever."

2021-05-20,"Honestly, this is amazing news. It was always obvious that regulations were coming. But if they are in the form, that businesses have to simply report transactions of $10k+, that's a fairly mild regulation and basically means, that cryptos are here to stay and can evolve.

Same with all other tax things. Just expect them to get implemented and plan a bit more conservatively to be prepared.


For instance, it seems like wash sales do not apply for now since crypto is considered property, not a security. I fully expect this to change (and frankly it seems not fully settled now). Even if crypto still remains considered not a security typically, I would bet on a similar rule coming to cover them specifically"

The next time you get denied access during big market moves, or get charged outrageous fees to move your crypto, or can't seem to get ""customer service"" to respond to you, remember: **you are not their customers, you are their products.**

Pick a DEX, any DEX. Make whales and institutions have to come to you the next time they want to buy crypto instead of allowing the OTC desks to lend out your coin so they can short the market and drive down prices in order to fill orders for the people they **actually** care about."

2021-11-21,"So on Yieldly it says you get ~47% APY for staying, but you can claim your rewards everyday. Does that mean in order to reach that ~47% rate you have to make sure to claim and retake those rewards?"
2021-11-21,Message unclear.  Bought Compound.
2021-11-21,"As somebody who's tried to use banks for the last 15 years, seeing an APR over 1% is a shocker. APY didn't even exist as nobody paid out meager interest in less than a year."
2021-11-21,"Thanks, dad."
2021-11-21,Great job OP!
2021-11-21,"You explained in words correctly, but your first two examples.

""So, if you invest $100'000 with a 10% APR, you will get a return $10'000 after a year (10%).""

""12% APR. That's 12% per year (or 1% per month if you want). So if you invest $100, you get 12$ a year (1$ every month). After a year, you have $112.""

Both of these are bad examples. They only work if the compounding period is 12 months, which means that APR=APY, and there's no discernable difference, or of you explicitly don't reinvest your interest (which is rarely the case, and you didn't specify). In this case, APY is always what you will actually make in a year regardless of compounding period if all money is reinvested (you used APR, not sure why).

Probably worth pointing out that APR is always less than or equal to APY, and APR is normally used for debt products (check your credit cards, mortgages, car loans, etc) and APY is often used for investments/earnings (check your ETF returns or savings account interest rate)."
2021-11-21,"Thank you, well explained and I feel less stupid. 🙂"
2021-11-21,"so then these investments like Wonderland that say they offer 97,000% APY or Snowbank 375,000% APY getting rebased every 8 hours, where are these APY #'s coming from?  

A lot of these have 8 hour rebase times, TITANO has a 30 minute rebase time and much less cost of entry compared to Wonderland/Snowbank and says it offers 100,000% APY.  Does having a shorter rebase time offer more advantage then a higher advertised APY?  Once you go beyond trading coins like stocks this shit gets more confusing 🤣"

2022-11-11,The thing is this is just a start. It will take weeks to months to unravel the damages this is going to cost.
2022-11-11,"FTX was as mainstream as it gets thanks to their huge advertising and sponsorship deals. Second-largest exchange on the planet. Your parents might have bought *the bitcoin* on FTX. 

This situation isn’t comparable to the earlier crypto Wild West frauds like Mt. Gox (weird Japanese site for Magic cards) or even QuadrigaCX (*relatively* small loss of approx. US$200m). 

This failure will take down a lot of people who have been the biggest bag holders of all. And now those bags are *gone*. Not only that, but we find out FTX has been actively trading against their own clients? And that other exchanges may also be doing this as well?

This is catastrophic reputational damage to crypto as a whole.

EDIT for people getting upset about my description of Mt. Gox, it’s how it would likely appear to someone outside what was at the time a very small community.

I’m definitely not suggesting it wasn’t a dominant force and that it wasn’t disastrous at the time - but rather that this situation is worse. 

When Mt. Gox failed, there were 24,000 affected customers and the market cap of the entirety of crypto was around $12 billion. FTX has over a million customers and the market cap as of today is around $900 billion (and of course has been more than triple this at its peak). 

Mt. Gox was proportionally larger, but FTX will represent a much larger loss to a much larger group of people - and will attract much more attention from both the public and regulators."

2021-12-10,"The misconception with shitcoins is that you **need** the shitcoin to go to a dollar or that the price even matters at all. None of that matters. The only thing that matters is market cap.  It doesn't matter if a coin has 1 quadrillion or 100 supply. What matters is the market cap. If the 100 supply coin has a market cap of 100 billion, how difficult do you think it is to get to 200 billion? Pretty damn difficult just to double your money. Now, the 1 quadrillion supply token has a market cap of 50k, getting to 100k isn't that hard. A cough could push it over. A million market cap will happen just from organic growth over time. As long as you do 10-30 minutes of research on your shitcoin, you'll be fine.

Most shitcoins that tick these boxes will make you money as long as you remember to pull out:

\-Verified devs: Don't have to be doxxed but they need to be visible along with their socials

\-Whitepaper: Proves they put some effort in the shitcoin. 

\-Website and all the socials: Proves they put some effort in shitcoin

\-Audits: Audits cost money which is an indicator the devs aren't there to honeypot or rugit

\-MarketCap under 500k: Easy to flip, biggest returns

\-New listing (1-2 days old): Catch that wave of hype

The biggest pump will come within 48 hours and then, usually, you'll see 1-2 months of downward movement before they shoot past 5 million, before trending downward again. Some rare shitcoins will surprise you and shoot past 100 million.

This is because the first few days sees the most hype and excitement. Everyone is looking for the newest thing. As it pumps the movers & shakers take profit and move on leaving a group of bagholders who believe in the project. 

The next big pump comes when things actually start happening for the project such as:

\-Exchange listings (Hotbit, WhiteBIT, BitUp, Bitmart, ETC)

\-Utilities unveiled(Usually something to do with NFTs or swaps) 

\-Marketing budgets are pretty fat from taxes

\-Definitely not a rug or honeypot

\-Devs are a little seasoned by now

Almost every shitcoin I bought in April-June are now 3 million to 400 million. All of them I bought around 50k-500k. But! If you hold, and holding is fine, you will see a loss of 50-90% for months between the pumps. If you're not financially secure you will not survive this. You'll invest $500, it'll drop to $250, you'll move it to this new coin that's been out for 3 weeks that everyone is talking about, lose 20-40% just in taxes from selling and buying, then that coin will drop 50-90%. This is **just** the token’s own tax and not your federal taxes. **You will lose every single time you change lanes. Pick a lane and stay in it.**

You either buy within the first few hours of launch and then sell when you get your 10x, or you buy and hold. If you hold, **always** take your initial investment **but no more**. Why? Because you're in this for life changing money not bill money. You're trying to build a nest egg of hundreds of ""what ifs?"". Any one of these could 100x. As long as you keep taking your initial investment out when it 10x you'll be fine.

Edit: Some people are confused by the taxes. Exchanges don’t allow for tokenomics in most situations but decentralized exchanges do and that’s where all tokens are born. Tokenomics is how a token actually makes money to grow. Example: Say you want to buy Shitcoin. If you buy $100 of Shitcoin you will be taxed 10%. That 10% is broken down into 5% reflected rewards, 3% liquidity and 2% marketing. 5% goes to the devs and 5% goes back to holders. So you end up with $90 of Shitcoin. Now, if you decide to sell, you’ll also be taxed 10%. Now you’re the proud owner of $81."

2022-11-09,"Joke's on everyone else, all mine were stolen before then. haha"
2022-11-09,">It's a stunning drop of historic proportions. In fact, if you bought Bitcoin in December 2017 — when the token hit its first major spike, briefly reaching nearly $20,000 in value — you're now down on your investment. And that's without getting into folks who bought it when it was worth even more.

2022-05-29,It was probably exactly what they wanted. And they made profit with it too. And it does not only give them a free pass to over regulate it also makes crypto look like a ponzi. Win win for them.
2022-05-29,"Imagine a guy runs a project could wipe off billions from the market in a matter of few days, then have the nerve to relaunch the same coin again.This is just insanely wild. 

Crypto needs regulations, or otherwise things like LUNA would keep happening"
2022-05-29,"so you are saying that a failed project cought the attention of regulators but the 10100222 rug pull projects didn't ? 

Definitely luna is going to be used as fire power to try and destroy crypto but the real problem ain't luna, this is the real problem:

1. People won't do anything to stop regulators to overstep.

2. People that has been happily sucking of the anchor tit all along for the juicy 20% thanks to it being  a DECENTRALISED financial instrument and now because they lost money they want daddy centralised government to wipe their asses...

Regulation kills innovation, if the government gets involved on crypto you are going to have the same banking system all over again, yes the one that even being regulated end up robbing you blind and creating instruments that benefit the wealthy over the average joe. 


People need to understand one very single thing, crypto = risk, decentralised means you are on your own, if you can't cope with it, go back to your - 19% bank account that the banksters and the gov can freeze at will."

2022-05-29,"I couldn't care less about Do Kwon. The real problem is that people are willing to risk more money than they should on alt coins.

It is truly an open and free market now, which fosters innovation. Unfortunately it also allows grifters to thrive off of the ignorant. People should only be investing in projects they actually understand, and should know how to manage risk before buying any crypto asset. Luna was 1.0% of my portfolio, because the anchor protocol seemed risky when I researched it before buying. It is not up to exchanges to police the open market - it is the buyer's responsibility. Buyer beware.

Just like I don't feel bad for a noob who brazenly thinks they can win at a poker table against people who have spent years developing proficiency  at the game, I don't feel bad for people who risk significant portions of their portfolio on alt coins and lose. People who aren't willing to put the time into understanding the tech should stick with BTC and ETH."

2022-06-14,[removed]
2022-06-14,Tldr: Sell low
2022-06-14,"Why am I hodling? Because I'm in the sweet spot - I'm 40 years old. Let me explain.

When you're 20, you've never seen a rampaging bear before. That shit is scary AF. It'll rattle you. Lizard brain engages, and you flee for your fucking life. 

When you're 60, you're too damn close to those retirement years to risk shit on high beta plays. You want calm and cozy - you wanna float into a soft landing in Palm Beach with your buds, a set tee time, and hopefully your first wife lounging by the pool. 

But when you're 40, you're in the goldilocks zone. I literally cannot give two fucks what happens over the next 3-5 years. I'm stacking fiat because I'm in peak earning years. My spouse and my careers are both downside protected. My investment horizon is minimum 20 and probably more like 30 years from now. I've seen two of these massive bear markets before - I'm a steely eyed killer. I eat beta for breakfast. This shit is the price of admission for the upside.

On a serious note, I guess all this means that everyone is differently situated. Some people should be avoiding crypto like the plague - for others it's a unique opportunity. I know which one defines me and my life right now. Once you make a decision to play, you don't play stupid. You play for the long haul and whether you're up 800% or down 80% is all the same - it's just what you signed up for. Be zen."
2022-06-14,So I should sell at a loss ? That's your great idea ?
2022-06-14,"Because time in the market beats timing the market always. I’ve been through many different market crashes in my life and the ones where I sold, I got fkd. I’m not doing it again. If you don’t need the money, there’s no reason to sell."
2022-06-14,"If your intention was to trade crypto, selling crypto now means you're about a year too late.

If your intention was to long-term-hodl crypto, selling after the markets dropped that hard is also the wrong time.

Anyone who thinks taking a 90% loss on an investment is a smart move should stay out of investing. You either sell before it drops or you hold until recovery is here...

2022-06-14,"Because at a certain point “cutting your loses” becomes moot.

2022-06-14,"We all know things are bad... Apparently we> the holders the only thing we regret is not having enough fiat to invest more. Selling at lose is not an option.

(After multiple bear markets you learn how to play the game) that's why we are HODLing no matter what"
2022-06-14,"I made a bunch of money off of the Dogecoin run a few years ago, bought at .04 sold at .74, and reinvested that money into other more ""serious"" projects. Since it was essentially free whacky money that I've invested I just don't really care what happens to it, so I HODL."
2022-06-14,All I got from this was hodl more. Buy the dip.
2022-06-14,Why should i sell if my investment is meant to be for 10 years and more?

2022-06-14,Impressive typing effort OP. Considering your paper fingers
2022-06-14,"Been in this since 2013. I've made every mistake it's possible to make. Now I buy during bears and sell during bulls. I never sell all. Just requires patience and discipline. I have no issues waiting years.

Forced myself to buy a portion every month all through 2018, 2019 and 2020 (only what I could afford to lose). Forced myself to sell at set prices in 2021 as it went up. If we are entering another bear, I have prices I will buy at, and simply repeat.

As for selling the rest of my holdings now? Nah. I always leave a portion I don't touch. No one knows what will happen next. There are no guarantees of anything. That's my hedge against that."

It's just the way the wind blows I suppose. Some of them solve problems, some of them make people smile and some just exist because we know that they exist and that gives them value 

People can be competitive over just about anything though I tell ya, there is a whole mess of cognitive biases out there to be explored in the investing world

2021-02-25,"Well, most shitcoins/altcoins WILL fail , and it isn't because multiple projects can't succeed. It is because 90% of the altcoins out there serve no legitimate function, they were more or less created out of the ""gold rush"" of crypto. 

We have over 5,000 cryptocurrencies right now. New ones are created everyday. Even if EACH ONE had a GREAT idea, it wouldn't be rational to expect more than 5% to succeed. There just isn't a need for that many different coins. Oh, and by ""succeed"", I don't mean exist - they've all done that the moment they were created. I mean actually take off in a profound way. 


I think it goes without saying that as bitcoin starts to become more and more adopted, other cryptos will soar with it. The ones that go with it will be the ones that have the best teams behind them, the most recognition, and the best function/service they provide. 

I can easily see 10-50 cryptos soaring to great heights in the next 20 years. Hell, even 100s of coins. Each major retailer might eventually use their own crypto currency, who knows? .....but that's out of 5,000. 


100 Cryptocurrency coins, out of around 6,000 , is about 1.5%

2021-02-25,"I don't really have a strong opinion on whether we end up with a shared ecosystem or a handful of category winners. My (boring) hypothesis is that we'll continue to see something similar to what we have now: Many coins and many projects, but only a handful commanding the lion's share of the market.

The closest ""real world"" analogy I can think of is the fiat system. Although there are many fiat currencies, the bulk of trade is conducted in the US dollar as well as lesser currencies (Euro, GBP, Yen, etc.) Perhaps another example would be trading cards. Although the supply of different trading card brands is endless, it seems as though collectors gravitate towards a small pool of sets (MTG, Pokemon, etc.)

I'm tentative to draw many conclusions from the existing crypto market as it's still so young and rife with speculation, but this is roughly what I see here as well. Bitcoin is far and away the category winner for a pure currency. Ethereum is the leading smart contract platform by a large margin (admittedly losing some dominance to DOT and ADA, but let's see how long that lasts). I'm even tempted to make the case that Doge is also the leader of memecoins and that nothing else really comes close to doing what it does (i.e. stir shit on Twitter).

Of course, the market is still deciding what it wants. Will the market continue to prefer bitcoin, which maximises simplicity and security at the base layer and outsources its scaling solutions to secondary layers? Will it take a chance on the likes of Ethereum which hold enormous promise but remain far from completion at their fundamental layers? Does the market /really/ care all that much about decentralisation, as we've seen with the recent BNB surge? Who knows."
2021-02-25,"Smart contract platforms are networks. Just like people go on the social media/chat application where all their friends go, people will use the chain where all the activity is going on.

2021-02-25,"While I largely agree with the sentiment, I think there's a couple of reasons for this.  One is that network effects matter, a lot.  The other is that there are a lot of scans in the space.  Lastly, while some are here just to make money, most of the OGs have some philosophical reasons for liking certain projects and disliking others over issues such as centralization, distribution, and censorship and these issues are very important."
2021-02-25,"Composability.

If you're a real Ethereum user, you know how important it is that everything can interact with each other on chain.

As I'm not a tech wiz I can't quite get my head around ""Airdops"" and ""staking"" but I can take 1 hour out of my week and collect cans from my workplace and friends that I then take to the local depot. 

Over the course of 2 years I have been doing this and getting around $20 a week or around $1000 a year and have been DCAing it into Eth weekly. As of now I have nearly amassed 3 Ethereum just by doing this. 

I've also got out of the house, away from the screen and made some friends along the way. 

If Eth drops then I'm not to concerned as this is money that would have literally been throw in the garbage had I not chosen to do this.

I am with one of the large national carriers and I asked them to flag my account. Someone needs to know the pin I set up before they could attempt anything like this. They don't have it? They aren't getting anything done.

The reality is that SMS 2FA is the ONLY 2FA option for some accounts. Not all sites work with Authy, Google Authenticator or other options. So securing your cell number should be priority one."

2021-06-01,If you have Verizon you can disable porting your number via the web UI.

2021-06-01,What if you have a password set for your sim?  Swapped sims to a new phone recently and needed to input pin to use sim in the new phone. Would that mitigate their ability to actually use your sim?
2021-06-01,"Yes, and Authy is better than Google Authenticator. Unlike what many people think, and unlike Authy, GA does not backup anything to the cloud, so if your phone is gone, so is your info. If you do use GA, make sure to use the ""export"" feature, so that you can restore everything on a new device.

Also, Authy has a desktop version too, which is convenient.

Edit: If you don't want your codes in the cloud, Authy backups can be disabled."
2021-06-01,Love google authenticator tho
2021-06-01,I recommend Authy or Microsoft (which is underrated)
2021-06-01,"Just some quick notes:
After you set up you 2fa (OTP or physical) remove cel number from account;
Set up OTP in a different device, use physical (yubico), use a cloud service, printed emergency codes, or whatever (repo protected and encrypted with GPG). Since you will remove sms, it you be a lot difficult for you also to retrieve your account back.
Don’t put your personal info in social media or another url unless it’s strictly necessary. If you really need social media, lie, use another surname, birthdate, etc.
Use SIM PIN. If your phone get stole, the thief will try to gain access to your phone putting the SIM in another phone, take note of the account (google/iCloud) that is locking your stole phone and will try to reset your account.
Once he’s inside your phone he can phishing scam your contacts or take a look at your bank/finance apps."

total that would cost $2,550. resulting in a $1,125 loss

2021-03-18,Oh man that's nasty. Makes you think coins getting attacked this way its a miracle that the big daddy bitcoin has stood the test of time and gone this long with no attack of this type being pulled off.
2021-03-18,Opct might be an alternative and a moonshot at the same time.
2021-03-18,Sold. Thanks for the profits Filecoin but I think this is gonna be a big blow for you little buddy.
2021-03-18,RIP filecoin
2021-03-18,"Hmm, willing to let the dust settle here before drawing conclusions, but couldn't this be Binance's fault? 

And man some of y'all are so quick to throw the baby out with the bath water. Finding and patching bugs is normal and has happened with basically every coin. It's how networks get more secure over time. 

This is not a death sentence any more than the ""Bitcoin double spend!!!"" story from a month or so ago."
2021-03-18,"Surprised FIL didn't drop more because of it, glad I haven't bought into the hype. Siacoin is the superior tech anyways."

2021-03-07,"Just to be totally clear they're not ""printing"" this $1.9 trillion. They are giving out government bonds to pay for this. Part will indeed be bought by the Fed, which is essentially printing money to do so, but a larger part is bought by all sorts of individuals and (foreign) financial institutions."
2021-03-07,Goddamn miners increasing the supply and lowering the value smh. After the airdrop I'm taking my 1.4k shitcoins and putting them in something more stable.
2021-03-07,I'll print my own money by buying more miners 😁

2021-03-07,"My middle-class American family will be getting $7000. Feels surreal, that’s almost what we make in a month and as active duty US military my income has gone up (normal incremental increases) and my expenses have gone down (legally not allowed to travel for leisure). I’m investing in our future, happy to say I finally have built up an emergency fund the past 12 months and jumped deeper into crypto and stocks."
2021-03-07,The amount of financial illiteracy in this subreddit is astonishing
2021-03-07,Further reminder this is a very small print job. Low interest rates print more money than any stimulus ever will but the issue lower interest rates don't get the same criticism as they help mostly the rich while the stimulus also helps the middle class. The people hating on the stimulus for creating inflation are the same people that begged interest rates to not go back up in 2019.
2021-03-07,When will residents of USA receive the checks?
2021-03-07,"Don’t try to fight the inflation and the printing of money out of thin air. Instead, see it as a feature of our current monetary system. It is one of the many tools available in the arsenal of tools of those in charge of mass scale economies. They are thrust into those positions by the electorate, and they have a massive responsibility on their shoulders. Lives are at stake. 

Don’t be so quick to hail crypto as a solution for everything. At least not until you figure out a mechanism where a crypto currency features tools to deal with something like a pandemic where people are stuck at home unable to work for an unknown period of time. 

And this pandemic is relatively tame, too. I can totally envision far worse viruses that kill faster and spread more easily. Everything is possible.

How would a Cryptocurrency help humanity deal with a pandemic. Don’t give me some libertarian BS, I’m sick and tired of idealistic snooty asses spewing their childish BS at me. The idea that “to each his own” is not how humanity works. We are designed to help each other. We will always be stronger United and weaker divided.

Update: to clarify, I’m very bullish on Crypto. I think it’s an extremely important technology. I am also actively involved in several projects that leverage blockchain and crypto currencies. However I have no illusions about what works and what doesn’t work."
2021-03-07,"Yup. Trading happens on pairs. The value of Bitcoin, expressed in US dollars, isn't technically just the value of Bitcoin. Its the ratio of the BTC to USD value.

If the dollar starts sucking more, that ratio goes up even if bitcoin stands still. Replace bitcoin with your currency of choice and the same applies.

Furthermore, if you are holding dollars at that time instead of holding crypto, you're still technically investing. In dollars. Holding dollars as they go down in value is the same thing as holding bitcoin when it goes down in value. You just don't look at a snazzy chart every day (or every five minutes) telling you how much those dollars are going up or down. But every fiat dollar in your bank account is an investment in dollars."
2021-03-07,"‘It does nothing but inflate the economy’

That’s the dumbest simple minded take on complex economics I’ve seen this morning. Thank you."
2021-03-07,How does one ride 'the financial asset inflation wave' to the fullest degree?
2021-03-07,"I’ve posted this a couple of times when it came up, but are we more worried about inflation than sending aid to US taxpayers? This is an instance in which it is actually valuable to be able to create more money out of thin air. People are starving, sad, and out of work. They need help."
2021-03-07,"The next year will be very interesting financially, the effects of the pandemic on the average person's wallet are only just beginning."
2021-03-07,I love people posting on here like they understand how inflation works. It is way more complicated than “government print money so dollar go down”. There was a post a few days ago about how 1/3 of crypto investors even understand how crypto works. That fraction is probably even smaller for the number that understand economics.
2021-03-07,Maybe that's why Bitcoin is back over $50k...

2021-05-26,"Very interesting, thanks for putting this together!"

2021-04-06,"**ETH**: Gee, BTC, what do you want to do tonight?

**BTC**: The same thing we do every night, ETH - try to take over the world!"
2021-04-06,"I sometimes feel like im always the negative guy here... but please don't fall for this bullshit.

These valuations are total nonsense. 99% of crypto has so shallow liquidity that any semi serious selloff will wreck it. People like to disparage Michael Burry for his ""small exit door"" theory reference to crypto... And I understand it... why does he have to piss in our bull run cup...

If anyone thinks this will last forever or that you will need one cycle to make it... just know that there was ""a lot of you types"" in 2017/18 and these people are now nervously sitting with their finger hoovering over sell button anxious not to repeat their mistakes (yours truly being one of them).

I'd love to be wrong... but folks... exercise some common sense and judgement or there will be months/years of regret."
2021-04-06,Cant wait to buy crap at the dollar store with crypto.
2021-04-06,Me and my $56 BTC portfolio rejoice. Maybe we'll go crazy a bit and splurge on a can of pop soda to celebrate this milestone. What a time to be alive!
2021-04-06,"What a garbage, clickbait headline.

Being worth more than the combined market caps of publicly traded banks is nowhere close to being worth more than the entire system itself.

The banking system holds trillions upon trillions upon trillions of dollars in deposits too, which has nothing to do with share price/market cap of the bank that holds them."
2021-04-06,And we are still years away from true global adoption. The potential..
2021-04-06,"Global economy, here we come!"
2021-04-06,Why compare a currency to a stock of companies?
2021-04-06,"Did this fucking guy just compare the total market cap of crypto, to the market caps of all the banks? Rather than the AUM of the banks? Lmao"
2021-04-06,"The title is misleading. This is not about the American banking system, it's about the market cap of publicly-traded bank companies.  There are a lot more private banks and credit unions not factored into the equation, not to mention the ""banking system"" value is not determined by the market cap of the companies that conduct the transactions.

This article is highlighting a useless metric that does not mean anything for crypto or banks."
2021-04-06,"These really aren't related things. This is no more significant than crypto passing $1,000,000,000,000 USD market cap. The stock valuations of banks are based on their capacity for profit, not public commitment of deposits. It would be reasonable to compare the valuation of crypto development companies to banks, or the valuation of crypto to fiat currencies."
2021-04-06,And already they can offer 50-100x the APR alone let alone the gains of the currencies themselves. I wonder if this will increase or decrease with mainstream adoption? Just the beginning or early birds catch the worm
2021-04-06,This only make crypto look like the biggest bubble of them all.
2021-04-06,Boom!
2021-04-06,"While this is exciting, it does seem disingenuous, doesn’t it?

To me “the value of the American banking system” isn’t “the total market cap of all the banks” but their total AUM or similar. 

Am I off on this? Seems an unfair comparison despite being a cool milestone."
2021-04-06,"End of year will be bigger than all banks in the world combined. 

But this  is all moot. FIAT is toiletpaper, and will be used for toiletpaper. Cows go moo and we're in a bull run and soon enough bitcoin will be the worlds most valuable commodity.

So bullish."
2021-04-06,"That’s wtf they get. They use our money for their interests and we get nothing, except fees. They used to put me in bad places with their return item and monthly maintenance fees when I was poor."

2021-05-30,"I renewed domain names and stuff when BTC was about $70.

That's the important point - they coins were only worth $70, so I paid the right price for those domains. 

Your purchases help bitcoin become the monster it is today. Thank you for your service soldier!"
2021-05-30,It *wasn't* a half a million dollars of fun at the time. Just $100.  Remember that.
2021-05-30,"Don't worry man that's not dumb, you could not have known how much it would be worth.

I just came from another subreddit, where there was a Tiktok video of some moron filling up the bed up his tarp lined pickup truck bed like a swimming pool....

But wait not with water, with GASOLINE.

Now that's dumb."
2021-05-30,"I feel you. I was 17 when Bitcoin first came out at .005 cents. I knew it was going to be big, I'd already been exposed to the idea currency would go digital. But I was pretty tech illiterate, and the wallets/security/potential of being hacked and losing it all intimidated me from trying to buy any alone, and my stepdad, a computer engineer, was convinced it was bullshit and wouldn't help me invest $100 into it.

Well, at .005 cents, that would have bought 20,000 Bitcoin, which at its ATH of $60,000/BTC, would have been worth somewhere around 1.1 billion dollars."
2021-05-30,don't beat yourself up. most people who bought at the time either sold it or lost it. charles hoskinson bought an xbox now worth like 500.000 or something

That is when you know you are nearing the bottom."

On the other hand, I always consider the possibility that this could be the last time we see prices this low, so I better take advantage of it while I can.

I was talking to a friend about crypto just today and explained that that's why I wanted to work some overtime this week. He said he wasn't going to put in any more money any time soon. I explained that if I was buying BTC at 50k or more, it wouldn't make much sense not to buy in the low 30ks. The fundamentals haven't changed, so why wouldn't I buy more when the coins are cheaper?"

Or you win, and you don't have to thank any of these insects on the internet either.

Regardless, your quality of life will be improved becaus you don't have to del with, well, this fuckin lam ass shot. There's a reason I ain't got any moons, I don't have time for this sph rical circlejerk of cryptococks sucking each other off and cutting others off at random

EDIT: I forgot I typed out this rant, and tbh I was feeling rude for a sec for using such harsh language but clearly enough of y'all agree😂😂

Sorry tho folks I think I just wanted something to be mad at. I barely even have any doe in crypto, but I do believe in crypto, so I'm going to continue to invest"
2022-01-09,I’ll wait for the suicide hotlines to be pinned here before I make any grand moves. Until then it’s stick to the DCA plan.
2022-01-09,Last time I bought BTC was 20k! I wish I could have bought more than I did but got all I could afford at the time.
2022-01-09,It's almost like 99.9 percent of the people you see here don't know shit about fuck...
2022-01-09,You do realize this sub has posts from thousands of different people with varied opinions (and millions of readers). You can find both bullish and bearish posts.
2022-01-09,39k looming 💀💀
2022-01-09,A person who started investing 2 days ago are predicting in the comment section.
2022-01-09,"If you are taking advice and price predictions from this sub , might as well watch YouTube . This place is a zoo of apes , lots of noise . Used to gauge market sentimental yes , see what is being shilled atm and fomod. Most of the vets don’t usually talk much because they have seen it all. The good ones probably come out to assure new investor and welcome them into this unpredictable environment"
2021-03-27,"I like Tyler S, dudes funny, just TA and news."
2021-03-27,"Great Job!


Also, fuck bitboy crypto"
2021-03-27,Coinbureau on top of everything helped me learn how to spell bureau.
2021-03-27,"CryptoDaily (not daily anymore)? His content has gotten pretty good, informative, and still entertaining the last year or 2. Back in the day it was definitely more clickbait-y.

Update - thanks for the award, lol. Ps - I believe Daily's name is Cameron."
2021-03-27,"InvestAnswers, Benjamin Cowen, Coin Bureau and Cryptos R Us are my go to channels.  No hype just solid info.

Crypto Capital Ventures does great TA too"
2021-03-27,Any list without Andreas Antonopoulos is terrible
2021-03-27,"I rarely post but had to add praise for Finematics. Literally should be in a tier of its own, the tech is the most important part of crypto and he breaks down these concepts in a way that average people can understand. Watching his videos has really made me drink the crypto kool-aid."
2021-03-27,"Just waiting on those Paypal Crypto Merchant Payments, JRNY"
2021-03-27,"Nice list! 

I also like ‘The Modern Investor’. A good listen while commuting or working. His daily news reports keep you up to speed on what the players are doing/have done. I like that his purpose for the channel is exactly that, to help and inform people. No sponsors or shilling. When I started out, listening to a year’s worth of his news videos plus the news of the day caught me up real quick about the big picture (the good and the bad) in the crypto space. One can’t say they ‘didn’t know’ after listening and reading.

He also has another non-crypto channel called ‘Money Rules’. I learned tips about investing in other things like how to start investing in *affordable* art for example, from him. Lots of good tips."
2021-03-27,Is Andreas Antonopoulos not a good crypto channel guy?
2021-03-27,BACK to the crypto verse
2021-03-27,"How is Crypto Daily not in A tier, at the very least? He’s funny, he doesn’t shill, his macro analysis is always well-researched and he cites his sources, and he uses great memes! Yes his thumbnails are cringey AF, but they’re often satirical."
2021-03-27,"I'd say Krown's crypto cave is S tier for TA and entertainment. Elio Trades is decent for education and calling out good projects.

Ivan is D tier. Every video is clickbait endlessly regurgitated 'financial markets are doomed tomorrow, bitcoin to $10 million EOY' type BS. He lost me about 3 years ago."
2021-03-27,Can I just add Alex Saunders from Nuggets news?
2021-03-27,"I did a quick scroll. 
He is mentioned once already but a new guy coming up through the ranks.

Jason pizzoni.

His videos look like click bait but the content is awesome. Does a lot of data analysis explaining accumulating zones, market hype and Fibonacci numbers on graphs. 

One of his videos he suggested to sell a portion of a position in ADA when it was near $1.40 the mob was not happy. Rotating profits is his thing.


And 

Andrei Jikh.

 Can't go wrong with the entertainment value/education."
2021-03-27,the modern investor.
2021-03-27,"I also like Rex Kneisley ""The CryptoDad"". His videos and live streams are very informative, and he always says he doesn't like talking about specific coins. Although he will if pressed, sometimes. I also like Crypto Love. He's a dork, and he shills, but he mostly tells you when he is shilling, and he shows graphs and trends and such, so he's a good 10 minute watch from time to time. He is huge into BTC and very leary of most other coins, so that's a good perspective in watching alts vs. BTC instead of alts vs. fiat."
2021-03-27,You haven't mentioned the Modern Investor....
2021-03-27,"okay, i'll say it: I like Ivan on tech. He's an entertaining dude. I used to watch him every morning. He stopped doing morning shows though so that I haven't been watching him too much lately."
2021-03-27,"Andreas Antonopulous?! Nowhere to be found, u must be kidding me. :)"
2021-09-02,The amount of scams that are going to take place on Twitter lol
2021-09-02,"Buckle up kids, we’re about to have a pump"
2021-09-02,"Great news for the influencers to accept donations

2021-09-02,This is going to be amazing
2021-09-02,"This seems like a VERY QUICK way to link all BTC and ETH addresses to names on social media. That's what I would do. 

If you are going to link people, link side wallets and not your main wallet. It will atleast make it harder to compile a list."
2021-09-02,"Hate Twitter, but I **love** the adoption!"
2021-09-02,Fees about to Giga-explode lol.
2021-09-02,That's just insane! I'm also excited that lightning network goes into a test drive
2021-09-02,"If it is implemented, this is incredibly bullish news for BTC and ETH!"
2021-09-02,"I don't trust Twitter at all. It doesn't have security, full of fake account. Btc in Twitter? Okey bullish but bullshit at the same time."
2021-09-02,Way to go Twitter!
2021-09-02,ETH too!!
2021-09-02,A great way to de-anonymize yourself...
2021-09-02,So.... When MOONs are coming to Twitter ?
2021-09-02,"See how easy it is for Big Brother to get your information?

They don't need to hack it from you, they don't need to get it with a warrant or force you to give it to them. They ask you to input it into your favorite app and boom there it is.

Everyone's address on a silver platter. Now they can know everything you do with that."
2021-09-02,This will likely force the hands of other social media and tech giants.
2021-09-02,"Okay but, leaked from whee?  Not that I think it’s BS, because Dorsey is big on crypto, but where’s the proof of authenticity?"
2021-09-02,I'll be sure to update my bio with my other financials as well.

2021-09-12,"I recently read a tweet that said:

2021-09-12,"It's almost like kids in crypto are like kids in Bethesda games, they can't be hurt...contrary to my ego when a 4 years old is a better investor than me."
2021-09-12,"Your kids are probably doing better then most of us! Good on ya mate, you're a good parent."
2021-09-12,E** has picked a staking strategy. You have to stake those coins for it to be effective.
2021-09-12,Kids picking better crypto than 90% of people here lmao
2021-09-12,"OP, please at least buy the 4 year old some ETH on the side.  This is a cute project, and a great idea.  But your other two kids picked ETH.  Baby girl is gonna be PISSED in 14 years if the other two are loaded and she’s got 1/10th what they do lol."
2021-09-12,"Why is there no ""-"" in front of your %"
2021-09-12,">E** (4 yrs old, girl): UNI, ENJ, CAKE.

I just found out that I am a 4 years old girl."
2021-09-12,"E: is 4 year old girl, picks Uniswap and Pancakeswap, because she loves unicorns and pancakes

God bless children! What would we do without them? This put a tear in my eye because it's just too fucking tender."
2021-09-12,You should get E’s cake staked. She can earn an 80%+ APY right now on their platform!
2021-09-12,"As a kid, I probably would have gone MANA, TRON, and RUNE. Maybe DOGE and CAKE as honorable mentions.

Videogames, movies, memes and deliciousness."

2021-09-12,Sorry for your loss. You created two shitcoiners:-(
2021-09-12,"Out of all these coins, id expect aave, crv and cake to almost definitely be dead in 10 years.

Enj, Uni and theta have a very high risk of going deas id they dont adapt with the times and get a bunch of big wins as markets move.

Lets be honest as well, if ada doesnt take - its gonna die a slow death as well.  Though I dont think thats likely.

Basically the only coin that looks ‘ten year’ safe is eth, and nearly half of those coins I expect have a really high chance of dying completely."

2022-03-25,The truth is that people in this sub are not representative of crypto. That's it.
2022-03-25,"Bitcoin is fair, not altruistic"
2022-03-25,"Using ""everyone"" all the time is getting annoying. 

I don't think the majority fully understands what decentralisation actually is, the fact that Russia CAN use BTC to sell gas is extremely positive for the ecosystem."
2022-03-25,**Decentralization is neutral and don’t discriminate!**
2022-03-25,Well I am here for the money
2022-03-25,I haven’t seen a single comment expressing that opinion
2022-03-25,I'm quite sure not **everyone** here says that
2022-03-25,Literally no one here has said that.
2022-03-25,"I got news for everyone in here.  Every country on the globe has btc already.  They’ve been confiscating it from criminals and “criminals” in America, Russia, and elsewhere for years and probably are some of the biggest whales already."
2022-03-25,Well no one said that so thank your for imposing your perspective on us.
2022-03-25,"Except that this supposed use of Bitcoin isn’t to help the average person pay for food, it’s to help the Russian government and oil & gas companies make money. Which they can and will use to pay for their war, not to help Russians live better lives."
2022-03-25,"Just leave then. Stop reading this sub and find an echo chamber you’re comfortable with. Sanctions are a great way to punish a shitty government. 

Yes, it’d be great if the US could be sanctioned into being better. Also yes, the Russian government deserves to be sanctioned. 

What do you want to happen? A hot war between two of the biggest nuclear powers? Sanctions are much better than half the world dying."
2022-03-25,"It's not just crypto community. He who controls the media controls public opinion.

When US/NATO levelled Iraq/Afghanistan/Libya and news showed people calling for destruction of USA and killing of American citizens on sight they were portrayed as barbarians. A regular American was dumbfounded by this because he is against the war and he couldn't do much to prevent it.

Now the media encourages and allows calls for violence against Russians even though they have little to do with what the government and the army are doing. 

I don't know if that's because Ukraine is in Europe and not far away in middle east or some other reason, but this whole situation seems surreal. 

News networks and media have moved from reporting news to manufacturing opinions to the point where Goebbels looks like a fucking amateur.

This fucking bs been going on for years.

People don't like think that their smartphones and clothes are made by almost slave labour in China/India, but they will surely denounce China on Twitter/FB/Insta.

Banks and Politicians claim that crypto is used for money laundering? Yes crypto - bad. Don't mind the fact that those banks and politicians have been found to be money laundering themselves.

Majority of people believe the media at least to some extent."
2022-03-25,"Who said that...? I have never seen anyone saying that on this sub. And if anyone did, it's 0,001% of this sub."
2022-03-25,"So, what's the point?

Decentralization is neutral. It's the decision of the potential buyers to buy (or not) Russian gas, be it with BTC or whatever. Most potential buyers are rushing to find alternatives to Russian gas."
2022-03-25,“Anyone can use Bitcoin including people we collectively don’t like” is essentially the dark underbelly of libertarianism. Every political/social philosophy has a dark side. We have to accept there will never be a perfect answer to anything and in the end come back to the moral philosophy that fits our core principles the best.

2021-06-07,"opens university and awards unaccredited diploma =

2021-06-07,">“Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam,” Trump said. “I don’t like it because it’s another currency competing against the dollar ...

If BTC was a scam it wouldn't compete with the dollar, people would not trust it or it would be illegal. 

What he really means is he is afraid of crypto because its the solution to the true scam: the fiat money."

2021-06-07,Why should we give a shit about what Trump or any other narcissist thinks of Bitcoin?
2021-06-07,Bullish? Lol look at the price

2022-12-17,A better question is where is Gary Wang? That guy literally disappeared and nobody is talking a word about him. Nobody knows who he is. At this point it seems like the nerd couple is being made the scapegoats while others vanish.
2022-12-17,She is in NYC chilling at Starbucks while she already snitched on SBF.
2022-12-17, She was spotted last week at Temptations in Manhattan…
2022-12-17,Probably running in her wheel and licking water from that upside down bottle
2022-12-17,She is in the north pole posing as Santa's little elf 🎅🏽
2022-12-17,"She’s cooperating, I don’t see much jail time for her, maybe a three year stint at club fed and then released after 85% of her sentence served. She’s going to get the better end of the stick, even if that stick has a few thorns.

Thanks to /u/BrettEskin for explaining how time served works in certain cases such as this FTX situation"
2022-12-17,"Probably she is busy with testifying, to avoid jail time."
2022-12-17,Girl snitched on her polycule mate
2022-12-17,"Probably building a case against him using all of the shit he’s been saying on podcasts and talk shows the last few weeks. Bro cemented himself into a story that’s going to get ripped apart in court, and of course Ellison will help because he’s been throwing her under the bus ever since shit hit the fan"
2022-12-17,She was sentenced to Azkaban. Dementors picked her up a couple of weeks ago.

They are doing this because they want to launch their own\*crypto\* (digital yuan) that is powered by crypto that can be taxed etc. I don't think they are missing out on anything tbh, if you look at what China does to billionaires I am pretty sure that they don't give a fuck about money like other countries"

2021-08-24,"Do you understand that all the mining machines are still produced there, and that the biggest miners are Chinese Nationals going to mine to other countries??? So BTC mined still goes to Chinese wallets"

2021-08-24,USA trying hard to be second
2021-08-24,LOL I'm sorry. They don't care. They know exactly what they are doing and their goal is to control citizens of China with digital yuan. They couldn't care less about bitcoin. They want their CBDC to be the main source of money because they can control it and oppress people with it. And when it comes to innovation they'll just continue stealing ideas from other countries like they did until now.
2021-08-24,Fuck the ccp honestly
2021-08-24,"No, because Bitcoin mining is definitely not the future; and whatever is, China will be heavily involved in it. These shit tier posts are rendering this sub completely useless unfortunately. I guess this is what you get as crypto gains more and more exposure."

2021-08-24,"Half of me definitely AGREES.  They may have shut themselves off from the future.  But the other half…..

China is not to be underestimated.  They are maybe the shrewdest government on earth.  I believe they know exactly what they’re doing.  Crypto, for all its positives, is the biggest improvement to the surveillance state since… surveillance cameras?  

Digital money being programmable money just leveraged China’s ability to socially and economically control the population by orders and orders of magnitude.  The possibilities are limitless.  Crypto has just as much potential for oppressive authoritarian misuse as it does for Bitcoin and decentralized finance maxis.  Ying Yang."
2021-08-24,"Id take a listen to the Bankless podcast on the China CBDC. If were comparing traditional economic systems, theres will be way ahead and already is in terms of digital payments. I cant contrast much to what the plan is in western countries for institutional/government actors since im not really sure what it would look like. I doubt it will be anything like AliPay, which is one of the current non-crypto digital platforms used in Asia already.

Id give the episode a listen, the episode only covers that topic, the rest is just an eth maxi podcast basically, and they are not pro china nor pro CBDC."

Its nice to see people who may not be well off financially putting themselves in a position to possibly be much more comfortable down the road.

2021-01-27,"Not surprising, the crypto world is PERFECT for today's youth.  Its a very young technology.  It allows you to invest very little money.  Its has wild swings, with irrational promises of instant wealth.  You can do it all online without having to talk to another, live human being.  If you dont have kids, you can throw a larger percentage of your income at chasing moons.  And if THIS is your main investment vehicle, odds are you haven't spent enough time in the world of ""regular"" investing to understand research, holding through bear markets, remaining calm, etc.  Hence all the requests for quick, cheap advice for very little money.

I'm also pretty sure the established investors and/or ones who have done well in the crypto world are sitting back.  Watching and lurking, as opposed to doing this much talking.

But thats just my .02."

2021-01-27,"People have to start somewhere.  Maybe they go from $100 to $100 a week.  That may not sound like much, but that is $400 a month, which approaches half a month's rent around here.  That $400 a month can turn into something over time...relatively speaking"
2021-01-27,I'm doing what I can with what I have.
2021-01-27,It’s even worse on those godawful Facebook crypto pages. There was this one guy last week sincerely asking if he should pull out his $200 now that it is now $188.
2021-01-27,"When it comes to volatile investments, always put in what you are willing to lose."
2021-01-27,"You're right, the numbers tend to be small (some exceptions), though I'd say that doesn't mean they don't have skin in the game.  In fact, per point #4 below, the ""small"" bags typically have *more* skin in the game as it relates to their ability to live.

I chalk this discrepancy in posting up to a few things.

1. People with money tending, in general, to discuss it much less, especially in mixed company.  Especially where investments are involved.
2. Small numbers are easier to talk about with others because the odds of alienating someone is reduced; $100 is money to 90% of the population.  Not many can relate to you investing $1,000,000 though, that's 1% territory.
3. The more wealthy want to hide their wealth; dwarves are a secretive race :)
4. If you're making $50k/yr (after tax) and in a big city, maybe you are not able to save much as it is, and so it's hard to kick in $2k and then not go crazy when you see the price drop.  That ""small investment"" is actually much more meaningful for them than $50k from someone making $300k/yr.  Despite it representing proportionately less of the annual salary, generally speaking the $50k is more disposable to the latter guy.   
 He can operate on $250k without skipping meals.  If the price tanks, he hodls anyway, as it's easier to set it and forget it.  The closer someone is to paycheck-to-paycheck, the more valuable even a small amount is to them, so possibly the more you'll hear re: lossporn and its sister, gainfiction.

Most of the time I see people mentioning numbers is (a) < $10kers, or (b) YouTubers who show us their ""trades"" and beg you to subscribe and smash the like button, but only so they know they're loved and DEFINITELY not to get some sweet ad money because they're full of shit."
2021-01-27,"Because 100$ for some people is 2 weeks of food 
And I think it's smart to put """"""small"""" amount at first to understand how it works"
2021-01-27,I started with like $75.  Eight months later I’m sitting on $600.  It’s just something I do with money I didn’t need at the time and probably won’t ever touch.
2021-01-27,Putting 100 or even 1000 in a month isn't going to make you rich with 6 yachts and 8 Lambos but going from 500 to 1500 is a big deal to some people and that money can do a lot for them. I am assuming you are a nice person who is curious but your question does sound arrogant and elitist.

Not everybody is rich, not everybody is poor. If you are curious about how much a stake someone has, maybe you should temper your expectations rather than assume everybody is balling. If you want to be surrounded by rich people, I’m sure there’s an ivory tower for you somewhere. Doubtful a public forum would be that place.

Besides, during this time somebody who can throw $50 into crypto is probably doing better than the average person is. In terms of investing mindset and/or starving/overdraft fees. Most people, in a healthy economy, buy crap that depreciates immediately. Why judge?

&#x200B;

Thank you for this post. Let me start by saying that when I was a young boy in Bulgaria I was molested by my father.

Then,  years later, I met a sweet looking guy with a beard and receding  hairline and I said ""Hey, what's your name?"" and he replied: ""We are  Cardano and if you'll allow us, we'd like to change the world""

I  was so inspired by this! I called my father straight away. I wanted to  say I forgive him and rebuild our relationship. I wanted to tell him how  much I miss him. How much I miss his touch. But he didn't answer the  phone. He was dead (please give some moons, I very sad).

I  looked for some consolation so I took my wife to bed. One minute later,  when we were finished, she said she's disappointed and that it was too  fast. ""Too fast?!"" - I screamed at her - ""You call that too fast? Look  at this!"" - I took my phone and made a transaction using Nano. She came.

In  the morning she gave me a kiss and reminded me to fix the washing  machine. I said she doesn't have to remind me about this every year.  When I was wondering how to fix that damn thing I got a call from Tether. They said I don't have to fix it, they will do the laundry for  us whenever we need.

PS This is financial advise

EDIT: I'm overwhelmed by all of your warm comments. I'm gonna talk to Tether and see if I can get you some free laundry."

2021-04-22,"This move is raw mountains of cash piling into Eth, probably from the ETFs

The most notable thing is that this is **not being fuelled by leveraged longs.** 

Open interest in the futures market has only increased moderately since the drop on 19th of April (around 10%). 

The long:short ratio has moved to more shorts, and less longs. This means that the price is most definitely not being fuelled by leveraged longs, speculative bets that need to close when they are in profit. It is buyers who want to *own* Eth. Big difference.  

This is massive amounts of money pouring into the spot market."

2021-09-17,"OP is absolutely right and yet he has created the most usless post of the day. And I don't mean that as an offense!

If a small amount of crypto can make you rich, people will buy a small amount of crypto. It's absolutely useless to reason with people about this. The driving factor is HOPE. That is T-H-E driving factor we humans have as a motivation. Crypto is used as a lottery because it CAN be used as a lottery.

People bought penny stocks, hoping to get rich, people will buy small cryptos. There is no ""think about the long game"". Crypto takes that and puts it in overdrive. And hello lifelong regret if you're THINKING about investing in something, but not actually doing it. If that coin or token then takes off, you're fucked for live and will hunt for the next big thing. (Which is one reason we're all here in the first place, dear anonymous cryptoholics)

If Crypto enables this, and it does, people will do it, and they do. The only way to shut it down is by - somehow - taking the hope out of the equation. If it's not feasable to get rich by doing this, people MIGHT stop. But that's basically not possible, so welcome to Lotteryland.

Sorry OP. What you describe here - it's 100 % true, yes - but it's the reality of Crypto.

2021-07-27,This hardfork requires **no action** for anyone who is holding ETH (Except for node operators). You can keep your Ethereum where it currently is.
2021-07-27,"I think this needs to be re-iterated as some of the comments seem a bit confused:

**This is nothing to do with 'ETH 2.0' and / or PoS.**

This hard fork is adding the following Ethereum Improvement Proposals:


  
**EIP-1559:** Fee market change for ETH 1.0 chain - A transaction pricing mechanism that includes fixed-per-block network fee that is burned and dynamically expands/contracts block sizes to deal with transient congestion.
  

  
**EIP-3198:** BASEFEE opcode - Adds an opcode that gives the EVM access to the block’s base fee.
  

  
**EIP-3554:** Difficulty Bomb Delay to December 2021 - Delays the difficulty bomb to show effect the first week of December 2021.
  

  
**EIP-3529:** Reduction in refunds - Remove gas refunds for SELFDESTRUCT, and reduce gas refunds for SSTORE to a lower level where the refunds are still substantial, but they are no longer high enough for current “exploits” of the refund mechanism to be viable.

&#x200B;

EIP-1559 is the 'big' one you've probably heard about and in conjunction with PoS can lead to a deflationary environment, however they are distinctly separate."
2021-07-27,[removed]
2021-07-27,"For people interested in quick read about what the update brings:

essentially it will change the fee protocol and mining protocol. Both in a negative way for miners, by making mining harder and fee's decided by the network. This will cause in more stable gas fee's, which in my eyes is really needed for ethereum, with the high gas fees caused by the current value of ETH. Miners are not happy about it, ethereum wants to stop further mining increase with this update in preparation for switching to POS."
2021-07-27,Presumably any current ETH holders will hold coins on both the old and new forks. Is that right? And how does that work with wallets etc?

2021-07-27,">	A hard fork can occur in any blockchain even Bitcoin (where hard forks have created Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV, among several others or Ethereum classic from a previous upgrade)

A bit of confusion between hard fork and splits here.

A chain can hard fork without split.

If a chain split one of the chain has to implement an hard fork change to ensure the chain stay separated.

Chain splits and hard forks are different things.

>	Whereas with a hard fork, both the old and new blockchains exist side by side, which means that the software must be updated to work by the new rules. Both forks create a split, but a hard fork creates two blockchains and a soft fork is meant to result in one. 

Soft fork can lead to split if they are contentious (like Segwit/BCH) while some hard fork that are not contentious will not result in split (see the many XMR/ETH/BCH HF that have not resulted in splits)"

2022-01-08,I’m typing this from the psych ward.
2022-02-05,There's a reason Kraken is regarded pretty positively around here.
2022-02-05,When will Kraken have full ACH support on its pro app?
2022-02-05,Thats what you call transparency wish more exchange did the same
2022-02-05,Well done Kraken.
2022-02-05,Now we need a proof of reserves for Tether
2022-02-05,"Meanwhile, Coinbase has a new user agreement that prevents you from taking legal action against them. Oh yeah . . . and you can't access your account until you agree to the terms. See ya, CB."
2022-02-05,"tldr; Kraken has conducted an independent audit showing it has nearly $20 billion worth of BTC and ETH. The audit was conducted by Armanino LLP, a consulting and technology firm in the US. Kraken will also allow clients to verify their accounts using third-party services.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.*"
2022-02-05,Kraken is a world class exchange and the only one I trust for long term holding.
2022-02-05,"I only buy on Kraken. If they don't list a coin or token, I don't buy it. 75% of my holdings are secured on my nano x. 25% staked on Kraken."
2022-02-05,"Ah if they only woukd implement ACH!

![gif](giphy|c2fYirOcbOLDO)"
2022-02-05,Politely waiting on ACH transfer to be available so I can go ahead and make my switch to Kraken as my main broker.
2022-02-05,I’ve been thinking about opening a Kraken account lately. I’ve read that they provide one of the best customer service among exchanges as well.
2022-02-05,Their proof of reserve is powered by Chainlink. Armanino the company uses Chainlink’s proof of reserve functionality to cryptographically prove the reserves. Cool the see LINK continue to be used by the entire space for the betterment of the entire space
2022-02-05,That’s how centralisation should be.
2022-02-05,Kraken is my new best friend.
2022-02-05,I believe Kraken is the best exchange out there. Period. It’s definitely has the best customer care as well.
2022-02-05,I have a positive experience with Kraken and I like their regular indepth reports. Binance seems more like a playground to me and they offer too many products I either don't understand or are too risky to me (yet their trading tool is ok).
2022-02-05,Kraken is the safest CEX in the world

2022-03-17,Can confirm. I was the bull.
2022-03-17,"Mine went from up 300% to -90%. I got in late 2017 and then the bottom was March 2020. It was tough holding during the bear market of 2018-2020 and then seeing the global markets absolutely collapse in 2020 due to Covid, but I kept buying solid projects and now I feel I’m finally in a good spot.

$49.99 sent

2022-07-26,"""Honey, the IRS called. They want to know why you made 52,487 transactions of $49.99."""
2022-07-26,Make it $500 and most of us will be happy. Looks like a lot of $50 transactions incoming.
2022-07-26,Looks like I’ll be buying my Lambo in $50 increments.
2022-07-26,$50 is pathetic. Do better.
2022-07-26,"I dont mind paying profits at all, what i dont wanna do is list all the thousands of transactions i made detailed."
2022-07-26,">Just now two US Senators have proposed a bill to congress that would exempt crypto transactions under $50 from crypto taxes. Good to see some people pushing for the right regulation of Crypto while keeping crypto adoption and government protection equally on sight.

How dumb you have to be to believe this is because of equality and social justice? The government just don't have enough resources to pursue ALL crypto transactions so they're just making it easier for them. It's in their own interest, not yours."
2022-07-26,Rather see transactions under 100 be exempt. Though I’ll just make two transactions and incur a bit of gas if needs be.

2022-07-26,$500 feels more appropriate
2022-07-26,This would be amazing for those of us who are into defi or mining and do many small transactions

2022-03-01,You don’t understand crypto. The exchanges you’re talking about are centralized. Freedom comes with DeFi.
2022-03-01,"Crypto actually is just a way to send payments directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.  The whitepaper say that in the first sentence.  It doesn't deal with ""freedom"" or ""war"" or ""sovereignty"" or any of that stuff.  The way it has grown up, exchanges are choke points, and that means the people that run exchanges become the important ""deciders"" in situations like this sickening war.  Even the most pro-crypto among us must agree, this raises thorny questions.  Exchanges could comply with government request, and how would anyone even know?"
2022-03-01,"**These exchanges are clearly centralized if they are able to be frozen.  Not sure what you’re taking about OP.**

Not your keys, not your coins."
2022-03-01,"In my view, exchanges are banks. They hold your money for you and give you ways of earning yield using their services. You can still have your own wallet and transact freely,  just not through an exchange. I don't hate exchanges for restricting russian trades as the whole point of sanctions is to put pressure on Russia economically. Crypto is and always will be free to use for everyone, but not everyone can use certain exchanges."
2022-03-01,"Centralized exchanges are basically crypto banks. Run by people. They're not neutral, don't be naive. If the people running these exchanges are not against putin, they're with him. There is no middle ground for cexes like these."
2022-03-01,"Waugh wah wahhh.

If you want decentralization you wouldn’t be on fucking massive regulated exchanges like binance."
2022-03-01,You don't understand either...if your crypto is on an exchange it's not yours...j h Christ this has been talked about for years...not your keys not your coins....

Which trumps your little self righteous belief system, meaning how things actually work."
2022-03-01,"I'm honestly tired of the narrative that the Russians can't be held responsible for what Putin is doing. 

Listen here, it's the Ukrainians getting bombs on their houses that have absolutely no blame at all, and are being invaded by Russian military.

Enough with defending the invasor."
2022-03-01,"Yeah crypto is for freedom, when you know how to use it.
Don't blame an exchange for laws in their country."
2022-03-01,Like everyone said exchanges are centralized . They can and should freeze funds of suspected Russians participating in the genocide in ukraine. Defi and p2p trading however is decentralized and that can never be stopped . The lesson here is don’t use centralized exchanges ever .
2022-03-01,"Crypto is a technology, not a philosophy.

Centralized exchanges completely nullify any revolutionary aspects of crypto when it comes to privacy and security. Centralized exchanges are beholden to the laws and regulations of their jurisdictions. This is not a matter of opinion, it is the legal and technical fact.

Don't like it? Don't keep your coins in exchanges. You do still have that option.

Frankly it blows my mind that anybody uses exchanges to hold their money. The laziness is unreal."
2022-03-01,"Holy shit a broken record of responses. “nOt Ur KeYs.. nOt Ur cOiNz.. urrrrggghh” ya we get it 

With the Rubble falling OP is probably saying it’s bs for centeralized exchanges to be able to stop
Russian citizens from putting money into an exchange 

Fuck Reddit is so damn dumb"
2022-03-01,"You want DeFi then use a DeFi wallet. However, the exchanges should be regulated. Tired of seeing bitching about this every single day on this sub."
2022-03-01,"Everybody in this thread is so hell bent on being right that they missed the point entirely. Yes, a CEX is centralized. It’s in the name. Cool, so that doesn’t change OPs point. A CEX is often the only way to convert your crypto to fiat so that you can buy necessities. Not every country is downtown LA with shops offering crypto sales everywhere"

Just my opinion 

Also 5% of American wealth is nothing at all"

2021-05-31,"Cryptos like our hail marry- like we know we’re are screwed everywhere else and we’re like “well maybe this will bring us out of crippling starvation debt....and if not I’ll just still be broke...”

I mean the stock market is clearly rigged- at least in crypto they are upfront about it- you know whales can manipulate but you can watch them do it in real time. 

Real estate is a joke atm- if you can afford a house you can’t really afford to not sell that house now- insanity prices. No way that’s sustainable.

2022-04-22,"Lol nobody is having trouble explaining why they think it’s a scam, you’re just not capable of hearing them.

CRYPTO LOOKS LIKE A PONZI SCHEME 100% to the vast majority of people.

If you honestly can’t see why, you’re wildly incapable of objectivity and should not be in the crypto game.

It’s fine to disagree, or even agree and do it anyway. But if you honestly don’t see why people think crypto or at least NFTs are a big scam, you’re willfully blind."
2022-04-22,"I’m in banking and I’m seeing an uptick in customers mentioning that they have been investing in crypto more and more lately. 

It’s my parents generation primarily and I usually try not to engage with them too much about it. Most of them are looking to pick winners like it’s horse racing or another form of gambling. 

One of my customers is big into stablecoin lending and just wants the higher % APY than the banks can currently offer as a semi stable option to keep building his wealth. 

It’s all really interesting."
2022-04-22,">Main argument is that it is a scam, but ofc no one can logically answer why, they act like medieval peasants toward ""witch"". No knowledge, just the same emotional repeated lies that crypto is dangerous, people lose money and my ""favourite"" that everyone should grow up and work in 9-5 instead of wasting money and thinking about getting rich

In all honesty, it's hard to argue this isn't the case.

CoinMarketCap lists \~10,000 cryptocurrencies. Of those, maybe 8-10 are worth looking into. The rest are dead projects, scams, or rugpulls. Every couple of weeks you get a new SafeMoon or SQUID.

Even if they have no argument, that statistic alone is enough to scare people away."
2022-04-22,"The problem is nobody has given the general public a valid reason to use crypto besides buying Bitcoin because it’s valuable.

I’m sure someone is going to comment on this with 50 different blockchain uses, but all that means nothing to the average person. Do you know what’s easy for the average person to understand? When a celebrity shills a shitcoin, rug pulls their own fan base and makes a ton of profit.

I’m invested in crypto and even I’m not 100% sure every coin isn’t just a pyramid scheme."
2022-04-22,"""in argument is that it is a scam, but ofc no one can logically answer why"".

Yes they can answer it. The value proposition for BTC is that there is a limited number of coins and the expectation is that there will be ever increasing demand. 

This leads to increase in price of BTC over the long-term. I do not think there is any real reason for BTC to remain at high demand. 

Current market forces behind every crypto currency is just pure marketing. They drive up exposure and hype the product and then sell it off to the 'retail investor'.

You can see this most clearly in the NFT space: as soon as a collection is launched, there is a spike in sales activity which then drops off to less than 10% of that activity after 1 month. After 3 months the market is virtually dead.

At the moment, BTC and ETH are primarily being used by middle-class tech bros to 'stick it to the man'. In the development of this, they are fleecing third-world people of their life savings.

Classic rich world capitalism in a nutshell."
2022-04-22,"I can “logically answer why”. Its a pyramid scheme. You always need new people to come in and buy it for more. Number two is that because it’s all digital this allows for fuckery. Hacking, developers running with the money, theft. Ive heard that big wallets with one crypto gaming company are routinely hacked and they do nothing about it (or are possibly even in on it). 

It’s still kind of the Wild West. A developer can say he was hacked and he seems to face no major consequences. That’s a big problem from an investment standpoint."
2022-04-22,">Main argument is that it is a scam, but ofc no one can logically answer why

You can think of this from the other perspective also, Crypto hasn't really done anything to give it a positive reputation yet, so without some shining example of what it can do the majority of what people hear is either volatility, scams or people pumping shitcoins for lambos.  

Crypto also lacks anything even remotely resembling a common voice, so all the opinion is fragmented and doesn't make sense unless you follow it closely and know what noise to just ignore."
2022-04-22,"Obviously the take that crypto on the whole is a scam is not fair or accurate, but the crypto space DOES have a serious issue with scamming, theft and fraud. These are the stories that filter out of the space. 

When you add this to the near total lack of mainstream adoption in commerce, I’m not surprised that many have come to that opinion."
2022-04-22,"It can be hard to inform yourself about something that is inherently complex, requires multidisciplinary knowledge, and has so much tied up in it that the vested interests that hold power, wealth, and influence, have made FUD, pump and dumps, and malicious scams the norm.

Honestly, most of crypto is going to fail, and take a lot of bag holders with it.

I’m sympathetic. Whenever I hear someone parrot the FUD, I recognize that they’re going to come around, eventually, when everything is crypto-based, simply because of its utility and ubiquitousness.

I remember the early days of the internet, and being mocked for my belief in its potential. Revolutionary innovation is like that."
2022-04-22,"That's because we're in a bear market now and overall sentiment is at rock bottom. Crypto is back to being ""a scam"" because the vast majority of 2021 buyers are in the red or altogether flushed out of the space.

If you remember the dogecoin craze last year you'd know that there are times when literally everyone and their mom is into crypto."
2022-04-22,Who gives a fuck. This sub is worthless. Follow your own hearts and minds and pay zero attention to the masses
2022-04-22,"I'm glad someone said this in a pro crypto space.

Crypto is DEEPLY unpopular everywhere else. Go check out the technology subreddit or search crypto around twitter. People, especially the younger gens, hate it with a passion.

It was supposed to be a big fuck you to the banks and the future of money and financial freedom but instead it's seen as a scam, ponzi, crypto bro cult, but most of the criticism I see is the environmental concerns. Honestly, those concerns are valid. Especially with the actual scams and shitcoins around. But try telling people to stop accepting pay cheques in USD because USD is used for most of the world's illicit activity and they won't see it the same way.

 I hope we eventually see massive changes towards energy usage scaling so the technology can grow efficiently. It would be interesting to see if this would help change opinions or if people just fall back on the other criticisms instead."
2022-04-22,"Talk to the average person about TCP/IP protocols and try to get them interested about it and they’ll also tell you to fuck off or glaze over.

Someone got a lot of money for disclosing this vulnerability and was perfectly happy to do so. They also are very wealthy and sought out coinbase themselves. I don't believe they asked for a bounty, so coinbase probably sent it as a token of goodwill.

2021-08-12,"I've heard you mention that you had a crypto awakening a few years ago (maybe 2017?).  My questions are as follows:

1) what were you up to before that?  For example, did you have a career in another field?
2) when you went all in on crypto, did you literally move the vast majority of your wealth into crypto?  For example, did you cash out a 401k or something similar?
3) if you did move all your wealth into crypto, did you do it all at once?  For example, did you essentially swap Bitcoin for your entire savings?
4) what percentage of your worth do you keep in fiat for day-to-day things?
5) finally, how fun has this process been for you?  Did you ever expect to become a crypto celebrity?  Are there any downsides to it?

Thanks for all you do.

Edit:. I'm getting greedy, but I can't waste this chance: in your opinion, what coin or token has the most delusional following (e.g., a coin/token with a community that seems exclusively propped up on hopium)?

I also do not operate with my country fiat, cos its value is totally shitty compared to the $. Totally free thanks to the blockchain and living my best life."

2021-03-05,"This is a really interesting read, thank you for sharing your perspective.


The geopolitics of crypto adoption to me is fascinating, you have countries trying to ban and suppress it, others whereby their volatile currency is at the whim of the dollar. 



Escaping that mechanism to protect wealth (no matter how small) is a huge selling point of crypto, and then in turn, as you say it can be used on payments as a currency too.


I think there is a very US/western-european centric view here, which I understand, but largely ignores some of the fundamental value in crypto.



Some of the most exciting things to me comes under the banner of 'banking the unbanked'. I was fortunate enough to spend 6 months working in India (ironic now) on micro financing and community led decentralised lending markets for rural farms. It is something which influenced me a lot and lead me down the path to researching crypto. 


To my mind you will see developing nations, both which are poorer vs the dollar /volatile adopt crypto and also those countries looking to catapult themselves up the global economic rankings via first mover advantage. 


This also plays out on the micro scale within countries as you allude to.


One area not discussed either remittances - a huge huge bed of economic activity which is made not only insanely easy, but also circumnavigates government legislation which may cause issues in cross border transactions. 


Thanks once again for sharing, I have just haphazardly given some of my uneducated thoughts on this (especially as someone from the UK), but massively agree with you and thank you for sharing. 


Can I ask, what is the current energy production methods for crypto mining? I think, what will be interesting, is seeing nations with this ability to mine using more renewable energy and also tapping into that market."

The problem though, is that some peoole who bash billionaires, think this is all good until a major billionaire shills your coin and you suddenly end up with 5x gainz.

But I rreeally do not like hypocrites who shut up about a ""helpful"" billionaire then turn on them when they no longer suit their desired narrative."

Things I see articles I read posts I comment on seem like I've already commented on them many times before like the same post just swap out names and places and dates with others... remember the phrase 'buy  the dip', I swear to God like 5 years ago if I heard somebody say that one more time I was going to go take a fucking can of ranch dip and smash it over my face 500 times... I think I might have and that's what's wrong with me right now...  buy the dip.... I remember when people started saying that and then it came back around again and then it came back around again with the memes and shit when memes became popular.... this is happening again.... people saying to stop following millionaires and celebrities and people with money....I think I might be going insane and/or having a stroke right now....kind of sort of brain on fire type of moment... but this most definitely is part of the recurring crypto life cycle I'm living....it eventually must j come back to the point of origin.... this has happened before I think.... Am i in The matrix?... am I neo or is neo a crypto or both? something like that because it seems everything that's happening now happened 3 years ago....this Reddit has happened before... right here...and there were the same amount of thumbs up on it....like 2000 something.... Jesus I must be going crazy.... no offense to the OP, I mean you're making a point, and you sound as if you're frustrated at the sheep following the mainstreamers, but your post and I'm talking this exact post just take the names and put some other names in there has happened before.... three or four years ago, and then again 2 years after that and then closely associated form of it maybe 6 months ago. 

I'm wondering when people are going to start asking who's Satoshi nakamoto is again that always comes back around every couple of years when people realize nobody's asked it in a while and nobody's really put it out there.. maybe I need some help some serious professional help.

While I agree sometimes people just shout ""we're early"", I don't think you've provided anything to say we're not early... except for the fact that it's not 2011 anymore (not sure who was saying that)"
2021-12-09,"This is dumb. We are still early. And people have unrealistic expectations. Both of these are true statements.

Being early doesn't mean that everything you touch will 1000x, it just means if you truly dig in and understand the market and trends, you'll have a significant advantage over the vast majority of people still. That's it.

There will be many more 10x, 100x, 1000x opportunities in the crypto space, we're only just getting started. Like there were 10x or 100x opportunities just within the last year. 

But also, you should never expect to 100x unless you're willing to do the work to identify opportunities. The issue really is that people think 100x is easy because they hear or see it happen to other people. But most of the people who get 100xs were taking great risks. They were...

* Investing in Bitcoin when the governments of the world could have made it illegal or stamped it out
* Holding Bitcoin through multiple crashes
* Using sketchy crypto exchanges like Mt. Gox where you could lose everything and there were no easy fiat on-ramps
* Investing in alts that were -90% during the coldest parts of the bear market
* Investing in projects in beta that could have been rug pulls or had code vulnerabilities that jeopardized funds
* Learning how to use Metamask at a time when there were barely any guides or videos
* Spending lots of time in Discords, crawling through social media, etc.

You're still early overall. But you're not early enough that you can 100x off Bitcoin or by buying the top 10 projects on Coingecko that are available on every exchange. You do have to work for it and take risks."

2021-06-08,They didn't use the tor network when creating and operating the wallet? Something doesn't add up here. Who would be that stupid?
2021-06-08,Thanks Satoshi!!
2021-06-08,"I'm not certain that's even the case, e.g. they got hacked and the rented server space story

Doesn't make sense

More likely is the hackers had it on an exchange either to convert it to fiat or they were in the process and once uploaded to an exchange they where able to take control of it either through hacking the exchange login or via supena or threat of reprisal to the exchange.  Pretty easy to trace where the coins go with BTC... 

The hackers could have alternatively gotten BTC and converted in relatively small amounts to monero through multiple wallets and inter wallet exchange, or asked for monero to begin with... Al be it asking for monero to begin with would bring much negaitive light on the coin and create issues for the whole black market and would not be a good idea.

So really, you extort a huge solum of BTC you need to have dozens of wallets set up and accounts set up at exchanges... So you convert the BTC into smaller amounts less then say 5-10k US send it in concert to monero and send back out to a new wallet, then send inter wallet a few times in monero to loose the tail.

It still takes alot of effort to move millions illegally gained.  Even then if you take to long they will catch on... So holding BTC legal legit and exchanging it in a wallet to wallet with smart contracts and no exchange is even better except BTC is not a fungible coin so providing that service gets you in trouble for helping in a crime and can be easily proven.

Exchanges do not want this business, to easy for gov to shut down your business because you have criminals using your service, even offshore is hard they can block you, go at you with IP and DNS banning, sieze accounts via banks for fiat etc etc

These ransomware hackers appear to have been super amatures"
2021-06-08,"Honestly, I find the entire story sketchy af... a group capable of hacking the keystone pipeline but to stupid to realise that demanding ransom in BTC is a great idea.... if you want to get caught?

Who would seriously believe that stupidity? I would expect that a real criminal network would know of privacy tokens, and demand XMR instead.

Probably it's a way to spin the narrative, that BTC is bad... but that they can catch you either way!"

2021-03-26,"True, but there is **no point** of cryptocurrency/blockchain if a centralised entity can alter it. 

If so, a normal server/software like current banks or visa is superior in speed and simplicity anyway."
2021-03-26,"You are right here.  A consumer at the end of the day will choose the cheaper and easier product to use.  The whole centralised vs decentralized debate doesn't really matter for them in the grand scheme of things.  People bring up stuff like Venezuelans using crypto all the time, but let's be honest most of them aren't using it because they care about decentralization, they use it because their govt messed up and they want to retain some value vs losing value in their FIAT."
2021-03-26,"Yeah, the base case average Joe is spoonfed consumer trash.  Until the transformational moment when Robinhood won't let you buy those shares or Visa does not support cryptocurrency purchases etc.  Then you realize you don't own money.

2021-03-26,"The problem with centralized ""cryptocurrencies"" is that they have no purpose or value in the long term. In the short term they only have value due to crypto hype. But in the end you could just run them on a centralized server. Take Binance Smart Chain for example. All the apps on BSC could just be run on AWS with centralized servers. Its only really valuable in the short term because you can run ponzi schemes on it and skirt money laundering laws for now (until govs crack down on it). In the future, when the hype dies down, why would anyone use centralized crypto instead of just fully centralized, traditional services? The biggest long term value of cryptocurrencies is that the rules (like supply of coin) can't be manipulated, its censorship resistant, cross-boarder, etc. A centralized solution can never provide these benefits. The big investors moving billions into BTC and ETH, such as for defi, will never trust a centralized platform."
2021-03-26,"Most people just dont want to join the cult. The cult of ""only my crypto project is the true one"" or ""you have to have bitcoin in your own wallet or it does not count"" or ""you must reject fiat!!"" or ""you must understand the future is dystopian - world government!!""

It is on the level of conspiracy lunatics. ""Everything will be crypto"" - it is easy for the normal person to see that there are maybe a handful of places they can use crypto for payment today. It is a gimick at the moment. Thus anything going towards ""everything crypto!!!!"" is clearly wrong.

""crypto will replace everything!!"" - well we still read books, watch movies and after the pandemic movie theaters will pop up again. Different but there will be. Radio is still there, as is video rental - only now it is digital and called netflix.

Anybody buying crypto will let their crypto lie on the centralized exchange after their first withdrawl - and the unexpected high fees going with it. ""You can dabble in crypto with just 20$"" is out of the window, once they met their first gas charge. 

""You can trust crypto, everything is decentralized and documented on the blockchain"" - try showing a etherscan info to your grandfather or talk to the cousin who invested blindly in one of the pump and dumps and lost.

""Oh you can get it so easily, you just need to setup your wallet on metamask, copy the contract from coingecko and then swap it ... of course oyu need to change the net first"" eh no.

""Look at these awesome return rates when you add liquidity - ah yes you did not get that? Well did you not read up on impermanent loss?""

""Your favorite youtuber shilled something without disclaimer? Yeah in real life they have to declare such things because there are consumer laws, but this is crypto man!""

One of the most relevant infos I got from this subreddit? Last crash the suicide hotline number was displayed? That is not where a normal person wants to be.

Simple steps are good. Small steps are good. Learning is good.

Just a few pointers

* they \*are\* curious. Give them something to try out with. Help them out by starting simple. Binance has problems, but as a starting point, to get your feet wet? It is a good one. If you really hate binance, use Kraken. 
* Tell them to go through the process of setting up an account. It will take a while. Then to send a test money transfer and save that in their online banking as a template (or show them how much credit card charges cost)
* If they have to, show them the trade interface and let them buy 50$ of bitcoin. And explain to them why the 'easy interface costs them money'
* show them a portfolio tracker like on coingecko and make a theoretical investment. Add bitcoin but also something volatile. 
* Teach them that money things should not be done on a mobile phone, where any of your friends can unlock stuff when you are drunk. If you have to and use android: setup a second user account to switch to with an extra pin. 
* Don't start with 'buy your mortage in bitcoin' but show them the power of a qr code scan with nano. It is easy, quick, cheap - and then let that be. They do not need to use nano after that. They can if they like, but the power of nano lies in it simplistic ecosystem. If you want to go fancy, setup a one time wenano spot. They know pokemon go.
* Show them 'the blockchain' as an example - not on your wallet, on a demo wallet. not for them to use or understand, but for them to get an idea what people mean when they say ""everything is on the blockchain""
* Bring them back to the exchange like binance. Tell them ""if it is not on here, you are not allowed to trade it"". Show them coinmarketcap and explain market cap to them, but also to watch the total trade number. 
* explain the difference between bear and bull market and that we are in the end run of the bull market - the major gains everybody is talking about cannot be done by newbies except by accident.
* Show them the numbers how well bitcoin as the slowest still has done over the years. Bitcoin good.
* Show them why bitcoin has become a store of value (and will never be a true crypto currency to be used everyday - it does not need to). 
* Make it clear to them that you will not hold crypto for them or buy it and that they need to talk to their tax accountant.  
* Explain to them that betting on crypto is gambling. Leverage trading is gambling high risk with borrowed money. Explain to them that casinos have to follow strict laws to ensure you at least have a certain chance of winning. 
* You may not love ada, but Charles Hoskinson recent keynote should make it clear to anybody with a business sense in  8 minutes what ""banked the unbanked"" means and why africa in this context can be a strong business opportunity.
* Then move on to countries like venezuale (there is a video with a gyu about hotdog prices and that 4 packs of rice cost his monthly earnings).
* show them what the stimulus does to moneyprinting - it has its flaws but the ""wtf happened since 1971"" website has some good graphs
* explain the bitcoin cycles - use the rainbow chart
* explain why something like bitcoin has holders (and what hodl is), but etherium has users. Show them the categories on coinmarketcap.
* Show them the idiotic nft buys - but then show them something useful with NFT (to go out of crypto: google the article ""1000 true fans"" and how the future can give creators a living)
* show them the difference on tradeview between a hourly, daily, weekly chart
* help them undertstand: save your money now, learn until the winter comes - and then dca. 
* and last I would recommend the david bowie interview from 1999 with the bbc, where he explains to a clueless interviewer the potential power of the internet. Most will be able to rememember that difference. Crypto or more web3 is like that.   
Once they nod ask them if they remember nokia / palm / blackberry - etherium could become like them (or not).   


These are just some highlights. If nothing else, they show how complicated everything still is - and also why the normal person is happy to use a centralized exchange. And if their bank allows them to buy some crypto or an etf, they will use that first - and mostly be happy with it.

They dont need defi with tons of problems behind it to get there, unexpected gas fees, unexpected bad players etc. Stop showing them potential gains - and instead show them how ""steady will beat chasing every time"" is good. And how boring and steady just bitcoin can make them double digits in a year. That is likely double digits more than their bank.

I was around when PC started, internet, social etc and have thus trained many people. I adopted a slide long ago, which really helped:   
""It is not going to go away, it is only to get bigger""

Once you can show that this is overall a new development - like from centrized mainframes to PC, from local networks to the internet, from the device in your living room to 'the world in your hand', you then can go to showing them that likely this will have as much of an impact as the internet itself. And it is 100% valid to ask questions like ""I have protection as a consumer here in my country, how does this apply to decentralized X?""  


From my point of view: the biggest service you can do your surrounding is NOT to get them hyped up and risk their money, but to make them curious. And help them understand to get prepared for the next winter. Even if it is a mild one: they will do better from there. 

ps: If anybody has cool usecases like f.e. the videos of vechain for tracking every single product, or helping scientist out by folding for banano etc, I am looking for them. ;) Also if you had anything that really worked for your surrounding to understand this space, please share too (dm is fine)."
2021-03-26,"Yup that is true,  around 2017 I was big on crypto but then I got disillusioned by it. 

1) Any body can create crypto, all 5 big banks in canada have a blockchain teams 

2) no one cares about privacy people willingly give away their info to Facebook /google. 

3) usecase for privacy is very low, who cares for privacy if you are buying groceries. Pizza.

4) people want security, just like credit card transactions that you can roll back, people will want something similar. Here centralized makes more sense. 

5 ) centralized coins have the potential to negate hacking and theft. Ideally you can trash the stolen coins. Providing more security 

6) The coins fluctuate in value a lot, only stable coins backed by well known entities will have a chance for mass adoption. Because it will be a brand that people know and work with 

To me the only value of blockchain is in its technology. Something like a SAAS  platform."

2021-03-26,"It depends: If the centralized cryptos have a solid commitment to scarcity and show themselves trustworthy, and the centralization adds value in some way, then they may survive.

But it is not difficult to understand that a centralized crypto with no limits on coin supply (such as a digital fiat currency issued by a central bank) is fundamentally worthless. Those naive efforts by governments will be a flop in the marketplace."
2021-03-26,"This is only true if you confuse people chasing quick gains with actual adoption (literally any other reason to own crypto other than insane ROI's). 

People generally don't care about centralization as long as they are playing with small amounts or as long as they are expecting extremely high ROI's. I don't think that you will find many people with sizable accounts that are willing to put a large share of that into a centralized coin. It's simply too much risk if a single entity or a small group of entities can just pull the plug or change some code and destroy your money. 

And what do you think about companies? No way that Tesla or Microstrategy would have put a part of their treasury in a centralized coin. The whole point is to reduce / remove counterparty risk (in their case, devaluation by the fed), there is no point in trusting some shady centralized crypto. They could just use legacy finance instead. 

It's true that currently most of crypto is still driven by hype and people chasing quick bucks, but after more than a decade, actual adoption is really starting to pick up steam. Within a few years we will likely see actual adoption eclipse speculation. Actual adoption simply does not happen on centralized chains. Centralized crypto has no fundamental value as it offers no benefits over regular databases and traditional finance. It's only purpose is enriching its creators and providing another way to gamble with your money."
2021-03-26,"so if you gonna build a defi protocol thats potentially going to hold billions you would build it on a centralised chain controlled by a handful of nodes controlled by one entity or a decentralized blockchain with thousands of independent nodes ?
You seem to forget that not the end users choose the platform but the developers choose the platform and the users come to the platform with the dapps that they want to use.
The data clearly shows this. Yes ethereum fees are high at the moment but this means some people are willing to pay that much because its worth it to them.
And with new technologies like rollups you can literally have low fees and the security of a decentralized chain. So why as a developer build on a weak foundation with these centralized chains ?
i definitely see the value in less decentralized chains for certain applications but for high value you want high security."

It's u/nobjos back with another analysis. Hope you enjoyed this one.

Any feedback is really welcome since I don't consider Crypto my strong suit.

The next analysis I am working on is Hard and Soft Forks and how they have performed -> basically how do forks affect the future performance and if it's a hard fork, should you stay with the original one or switch to the new one?

Also, another interesting way would be to invest $1 into every single crypto that hits crytomarketcap and see whether it would be profitable (totally impractical given the transaction costs, but should be fun to see what would happen)

Two incorrect things about it are that:

1. The moonshot coins are usually in the 300-1000 on coinmarketcap rank, not in top 100. By the time a coin has reached the front page its already too late for it to be a ""moonshot"". So your definition is off.

2. The ""top 10"" coins performance is 90% due to just eth. Look at coins like XRP and LTC. They have done dick all in the last bull run. 

ETH has outperformed everything else in my portfolio and I didnt just do a write up on this stuff, I invested in 150 coins in the last 5 years so I know from experience of looking at this stuff daily for the past half a decade. If I only bought ETH and absolutely nothing else I would have been an easy millionaire by now."

2022-04-26,"It's a really nice analysis, well done.

Only possible feedback is that any data from before 2017 is not going to be useful to modern investing strategies. Essentially your analysis says ""damn bro, you missed out on the stratospheric gains of ethereum and bitcoin in 2014-17"" - which isn't *helpful*. These coins now have extremely large market caps, and any percentage gains are going to be less meteoric. Your limitations section kind of covers this, but then you totally ignore it while making your conclusion. Your own chart says that following the top 90 for the last 2 years gave better gains, and should this trend continue - the conclusion would be wrong."
2022-04-26,"/u/nobjos this is a gold mine! Excellent work! I've always wondered what a simple altcoin strategy might be to outperform Bitcoin.

To have more faith in the outcome, the strategy should be tested using rebalance dates of each of the 12 months of the year, so there's no risk of data-mining a brittle Jan. 1 bias in the historical data.

It would also be interesting to see if rebalancing quarterly or monthly performs about the same as rebalancing yearly.

Finally, checking the top 3, 5, 10, 20, and 50 cryptos might also be useful in determining how special the ""top 10"" cryptos are vs. top 100 or top 1 (Bitcoin), so there's less data-mining bias.

By the way, there is an index ""fund"" that you can buy as a crypto token which approximates this strategy, the Crypto 20 Index, though it's partly market-cap weighted and not available to U.S. investors: [https://invictuscapital.com/en/crypto20](https://invictuscapital.com/en/crypto20)

2022-12-01,"He openly admitted to it being a ponzy scheme in an interview. He didn't call it a ponzi scheme, but what he was describing was one. The interviewers started laughing once they realized what he was doing."

""Please ask him if he thinks what happened was fraud.""
  

  
Sorkin added that he had gotten several similar letters, before asking Bankman-Fried: ""What do you tell this man?""
  

  
""I am deeply sorry about what happened,"" he replied. 
  

  
Bankman-Fried added that the FTX.US platform was still ""fully funded"" and he believed withdrawals ""could be opened up today.""
  

  
He then went on a long explanation of Alameda's risky trade positions, before blaming an ""all-out PR assault, which led to a total market collapse in a pretty short period of time.""

**Later on in the DealBook interview, SBF also said he doesn't think he's ""criminally liable"" for FTX's implosion.**"
2022-12-01,"I watched that whole interview. I’ve attended plenty of conferences with an economic focus. It was very weird financial interview for several reasons. 

1. Aaron Ross Sorkin’s *stern dad voice* coupled with Sam Bankman-Fried *teenager in trouble* slump + nervous leg shaking made me keep forgetting that I was listening to a top flight financial investigative reporter interview the CEO of a former unicorn.  The vibe or tone was very *you are in big trouble, buddy* and unprofessional. 

2. The first half was muddled and questions jumped all over the place, SBF did a lot of verbal wandering around. I expected better from Sorkin. For example, SBF responded to Sorkin’s question about Bahamas residential property purchased by/for his parents (two Stanford Law professors) with some waffley “they were never going to live there long term” or something and that they were living in the property while they “did some work” for his company. What? No follow up. Sloppy. 

3. Sorkin asking if VC firma like Sequoia (who invested in FTX and thus contributed to its veneer of legitimacy) carried some blame for FTX’s failure to manage its exposure to risk by failing to do proper due diligence! Are you kidding me?  I agreed with SBF’s answer which was, essentially, Sequoia judged the potential upside worth the risk. Has Sequoia imploded? No. They took a risky bet and lost. That’s VC. I don’t understand what the hell Sorkin was trying to do here. 

4. Why did SBF do the interview? It was so soft, stern dad voice aside… I kinda feel like it was arranged. It felt like SBF wanted to shape the court of public opinion with a “I got in over my head” defense. And Sorkin soft pitched. Why? That I don’t know."

2021-10-23,"Kucoin is probably fine if you just buy and forget.

If you intend to do serious trades and leverage, better avoid Kucoin like a plague. 

I heard too many of such stories on their sub-reddit."
2021-10-23,"Let’s face it. All the big CEXs deliberately tank their websites during periods of volatility. I certainly assumed this was the reason… but looks like you have proved it. Well done, sir."
2021-10-23,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but this looks to me clearly as if this is just a server outage. Perhaps the servers got overloaded as it's peak demand and that's why it said the host didn't connect? The same thing happens with coinbase sometimes. That'd explain why the backend was still running, as backends run on different web servers altogether (and perhaps could scale better to adjust for peak demand depending on how well they built it)

And the rate limiting stuff, idk man. Rate limiting is pretty much a webdev standard, and perhaps it's not even KuCoin's fault here and it's cloudflare falsely flagging your requests as malicious?

Either way, the ban was completely unnecessary."

2022-04-27,"The way this post is framed, makes it sound like there must be a connection between these two events. But Satoshi had already decided to step down and let others take over the development. This was always his plan: create Bitcoin anonymously and disappear. And this is why he gave Gavin access to the Bitcoin Github."
2022-04-27,"Satoshi could very much have mined or even bought Bitcoin on a new wallet, be a millionaire today and never need to touch his public wallets. I believe this is the most likely scenario. Even Vitalik definitely has private wallets that no one knows of, why wouldn’t anybody in their position do this?"

That or he's got amazing will power,  or lost his seed"
2022-04-27,I'm still not convinced Satoshi is just one person
2022-04-27,"There are many possibilities of what happened to Satoshi.

My *optimistic* take is that Satoshi knows the mystery of his identity and fate is important to the story of Bitcoin. He’s probably distrustful of governments and values privacy, so does not want any spotlight. And, likely, he would’ve been active with Bitcoin and crypto in the years afterward, so he’s probably rich from that anyway. And maybe he thinks that if he tried to cash out the original wallet, he’d crash the price.

Also possible that Satoshi is a group of the original devs. Maybe they each have a fragment of the key and can’t cash out til they all agree to it. And again maybe they value the mystery of Satoshi, so none will spill the beans.

I hope we someday find out the whole story."
2022-04-27,He posted to dissuade conspiracy theories. Now it’s evidence for one. lol
2022-04-27,Would you really want to be the public figurehead of something under so much scrutiny? I reckon he’s on an island somewhere chuckling at all the speculation
2022-04-27,Satoshis last post was about the beast being awakened and he did not want it to happen this way when the only way to donate to wikileaks was through btc after the us govt shut down their PayPal/MasterCard donations. Then btc crossed 1$ and he only logged in once since to say “I am not Dorian”

Satoshi had disappeared long before Gavin was invited to the CIA."

The very people beating down Afghanistan right now have a *lot* of money. So does the government of Afghanistan. How much money did the US pour into this 20 year war that was siphoned off by greedy contractors and investors? American elite, Afghan elite, the Taliban, and god knows who else have been siphoning off of that money this entire time.  


I do not live in Afghanistan but I've been watching this from within. It is actually ridiculous how many members of the Taliban are actively engaged on social media. It wasn't hard to watch as these dudes shook hands with politicians in Afghanistan while directing the Afghan army in deliberately poor ways. The Taliban was able to make this happen as fast as they were because they were given the ability to.   


Absolutely no currency can fix this. Not even the USD when it was at one of it's strongest values. Unfortunately, this is the case for quite a lot of countries.

2021-06-30,"#Need-to-know info for newcomers:

First off, great job spotting this, and better job for everyone giving helpful advice in this thread. Viruses read your clipboard too (on mobile or desktop), which means this is also a method that can be used to steal your private keys.                

The same issue that the O.P. encountered in this thread is the same exact reason why you would never ever want to store your private keys / recovery phrase / seed phrase in a notepad file, or email yourself your private keys. More advanced viruses can also read screenshots you have taken, so storing them as image files is not good either. Do not store them in any digital medium except for a hardware wallet.  If you have a locker or a place where you can store papers that nobody else has any access to, then writing down your recovery phrase on paper should be secure enough."
2021-06-30,Oh damn. Great that you spotted it
2021-06-30,This is the shit that keeps me up at night…
2021-06-30,"Yes that sounds like a clipboard virus. Always confirm the address like you have. This is a pretty common crypto virus to get, so you should remedy that ASAP"
2021-06-30,"Hi u/SlappySpankBank,

2021-06-30,"Yes, it's a clipboard hijacker. Good job on double-checking the address before sending -- exactly like you should be doing"
2021-06-30,There is a virus. Searching for it one sec
2021-06-30,"Run a malware bytes scan, stuff like this does happen so it's definitely possible its a virus"
2021-06-30,I would say 100% virus if something is accessing your clipboard. I would disconnect your PC from the internet and run a virus scan. Personally I would reinstall OS to be sure though.
2021-06-30,"Yes this is malware. Careful where you download.  I wiped my computer to get rid of it since 3 different virus programs couldn't find the issue.

Good catch and good thing you verified the address."
2021-06-30,"If you can afford it, buy a fresh low end laptop you use only for crypto stuff.

You can find some for relatively ""cheap"" prices around 300-400 bucks.

Basically you should keep this computer offline most of the time, not storing anything on it and use it for every crypto related stuff. 

It's definitely worth the investment especially knowing that a loss of 1k can make you miss an upside of 10x within a year. (Trust me, it's painful)."
2021-06-30,Malware or virus.  NOT normal. Do not send
2021-06-30,"&#x200B;

100% you have been compromised. This is one of the most common ways for hackers to steal crypto. I would completely re-format and reinstall everything before entering in any passwords"

2. Thanks to the whole community for the eye opening conversation. I didn’t even know that was a thing until this thread"
2021-06-30,This is why you always send like 1 dollar worth of crypto first and make sure it works. Then send the lot.
2021-06-30,"Yep, that's a virus, and it's not uncommon.  It's why everyone advises you to double check any addresses you copy-paste.  Well done for spotting it."
2021-06-30,"To help other users. can you let us know your operating system version and browser version, which anti-virus software you already used or had installed, and which one(s) did you use to detect the viruses? Thanks."
2021-06-30,Burn the pc just to be safe

After 6 years, the only think I see for BTC in the short term, before it can evolve, it has to overcome the correlation with the stock market, it was never ever that high.

another win for Defi"
2021-07-01,"I work for a trading company that also deals with cryptos, I think I know what happened here.

Ach deposits are credited up front, meaning they will credit the funds without actually them receiving them (yet). After 5 or 6 days if the funds do not arrive, the deposit is considered failed and the funds will likely never arrive, therefore the funds credited to you have to be deducted. 

Speak with your bank op, where you actually charged? 

The fucked up thing is the way they handled it, no communications. 

I don't think binance needs to steal 1k usd from anyone, they probably make profit double that in seconds. Just my two cents"
2021-07-01,Wow this is some shady stuff
2021-07-01,"Disclaimer: I am not defending Binance.US. there are plenty of posts revealing how shady they are. There are a million better exchanges. 

The 3-4 am is likely not as suspicious as you think it is. Banks (and exchanges) run a day-end batch process to validate and check numbers and they try and do this during times of low traffic. This likely happens every night and OP somehow got caught in one of their generated reports. This doesn't excuse the missing money, just explains the timing."

I highly doubt Binance is systematically stealing thousands of dollars from transfers. I would escalate the issue and make sure to provide documentation that the transfer went through to them.

**Ironically this transaction demonstrates the value of the blockchain. Had you sent crypto instead of fiat the transaction would be immortalized and auditable!**"

Sorry for your loss, i hope you can get that money returned, and thank you for showing this to other users so those who dont know, they are aware of Binance US problems."

**It is not too late to stop** the bad Warren/Portman amendment. **A few more hours are left** \- it only takes **a few minutes and is actually fun** to contact your senators to request that they support the good amendment (i.e. the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment). 

  
There are some reports that our 'Crypto community' calls and emails are starting to have an impact!

  
**1. Call your Senators:**  
One of the easiest options is automated call (need to have 'silence/block' of unknown callers disabled or use landline) - in **2-5min** you can call both your senators and talk to staff or leave a voicemail - some say over the last hours the tool is sometimes unreachable and voicemails are full, but most users confirm the tool still works and most were able to at least leave voicemails:

  
**https://www.fightforthefuture.org/actions/stop-the-senate-from-sneaking-through-total-surveillance-of-the-crypto-economy/** 

&#x200B;

  
**2. Email or contact your senator through official government contact info:**   
Either you can use an automated email tool that Coinbase had setup - takes less than 1min :   
[**https://p2a.co/y19AJ6V**](https://p2a.co/y19AJ6V)

  
or find email contact forms on the offical goverment site:   
[**https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm**](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm)

  
If you just want to **copy&paste good language** in your email instead of writing it yourself this text was suggested by the coinbase tool: 

  
*""Dear Senator,*   
*The Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment is the only amendment that actually is a compromise.  The Warner amendment is anti-technology and anti-innovation.*  
*A vote for the Warner amendment would be irresponsible and dangerous to America’s national security.*  
*Any narrative that this is a compromise on the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment is false. This Warner amendment does not address the shortcomings of the bill. The Warner amendment is worse than the existing text of the bill.*   
*Without any consideration or explanation, it picks one crypto protocol and condemns others to be crushed under impossible burdens. The United States has succeeded in becoming a leader in innovation because it regulates activities, not specific technologies, and it does so neutrally. It is one thing to regulate (or exempt from regulation) distributed ledger validators, but it is wholly another to pick one winner among different types of validation technologies.*  
*Sen. Warner’s amendment would kill Ethereum and other proof-of-stake protocols. Ethereum is the leading smart-contract platform on the internet that enables countless use cases that provide cheaper, more inclusive services to Americans. It’s like killing the World Wide Web in its infancy.*  
*Sen. Warner’s amendment would drive away all innovation to outside of the United States. By favoring proof-of-work (the oldest consensus method) in statute, Sen. Warner’s amendment locks the U.S. into one technology. This is like picking which of the early protocols would form the backbone of the Internet. Proof of work was the first validation method invented; that doesn’t mean that it is the one that will be most useful/successful. Why should the IRS put its thumb on the scale?*  
*US leadership in digital finance is critical to America’s future and our leadership over China. Removing protections for software developers in the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment is a direct push to have crypto development and innovation take place outside the US.""*"

TLDR: Loopring is a zero knowledge roll up that inherits the security of Ethereum and validates transactions off chain on Layer two in bundles reducing gas fees to pennies the dollar. 

Loopring also has a superior order matching protocol in their [patent](https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=2&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=Loopring&OS=Loopring&RS=Loopring)

Here is their [whitepaper](https://loopring.org/resources/en_whitepaper.pdf) abstract summary 👇

“Loopring is an open protocol for building decentralized exchanges. Loopring operates as a public set of smart contracts responsible for trade and settlement, with an off-chain group of actors aggregating and communicating orders. The protocol is free, extensible, and serves as a standardized building block for decentralized applications (dApps) that incorporate exchange functionality. Its interoperable standards facilitate trustless, anonymous trading. An important improvement over current decentralized exchange protocols is the ability for orders to be mix-and-matched with other, dissimilar orders, obviating the constraints of two-token trading pairs and drastically improving liquidity. Loopring also employs a unique and robust solution to prevent front-running: the unfair attempt to submit transactions into a block quicker than the original solution provider. Loopring is blockchain agnostic, and deployable on any blockchain with smart contract functionality. At the time of writing, it’s operable on Ethereum [1] [2] and Qtum [3] with NEO [4] under construction.”

Let’s not forget they have [social recovery](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html) for your wallet."
2021-12-31,"tldr; Loopring is a low-cost alternative to Ethereum's gas fees. On a good day, a simple transaction where you would send ETH from one wallet to another would cost 16% of the total transaction. This makes Ethereum completely fail its purpose of recreating traditional finance within the blockchain space. Loopring uses an automated market maker to set the exchange rate between tokens.

2021-12-31,"LRC provides solution for cheaper gas

* Loopring uses an automated market maker (AMM) to set the exchange rate between tokens. Although the platform's fees are not zero, they are very close. 

* Compared to Ethereum's 16%, the current swap fee on Loopring is 0.3%. As you would expect, the fee funds the protocol: 0.2% goes to liquidity providers (LPs), and 0.1% goes to the Loopring developers.

Here's how:

I'm a firm believer that if you commit to a four year cycle, you can't go wrong.  For every dollar you spend on crypto, commit to holding until one year after the next Bitcoin halving, at which point you reassess, but not necessarily sell.  You'll probably need to rebalance your portfolio along the way, but keep it in crypto.  Don't sell.

I'm all in on Bitcoin, but now that Bitcoin has gotten too expensive for me to afford ($1,000 doesn't go far these days), I buy alts with the intent of outperforming Bitcoin and then swapping them for Bitcoin.  In a nutshell, that's my strategy these days.

I know this isn't going to be as popular as yelling rockets moons rockets moons and bragging about taking profits, but I'd rather be helpful than popular.  I'm not interested in taking profits.  I want to accumulate even though I'm on a tight budget.  I have my eye on 2025, 2029, and 2033.  Sacrifices now will pay off later.

#What the fuck is ETH?

In short, ETH is the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum smart contract platform. It is the second largest cryptocurrency by marketcap (see a list here: https://www.coingecko.com/en).

**So why Ethereum and what makes it different to Bitcoin?**

One way to think of Bitcoin vs Ethereum is if Bitcoin is a calculator, then Ethereum is a desktop computer. Like a calculator can only do maths (but it does it well), Bitcoin is good at one thing and that is being a currency/scarce store of value with only 21 million coins. Ethereum on the other hand is a computer. It is a turing complete decentralised computer which can run a wide range of programs. One use case for this is DeFi (Decentralised Finance) which is where you can get loans or earn interest on cryptocurrencies or US dollar stable coins in a permissionless, peer to peer manner. To simplify that, you can access loans, lend money and make interest and buy synthetic assets (cryptocurrencies which match the price action of real world assets like gold or Tesla stock) all without needing to ask a bank, broker or government to allow you or help you do it. You can do it all on your own through the new open financial system built on Ethereum. But use cases don't stop there. Ethereum also has NFTs or ""Non-Fungible Tokens"" which are unique coins. These are used for things like tokenising ownership real world assets such as real-estate and letting people buy fractions of it (see [RealT tokens](https://realt.co/)) or for gaming. See [God's Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/), a Hearthstone-like card game where the cards are NFTs which are tradeable on the open market. Imagine a future where Fortnite skins and COD Warzone items have real world value and are traded on Ethereum.

These use cases only scratch the surface of what Ethereum can do.

**So what do I do? Where do I buy ETH?**

Don't just FOMO into ETH because we told you to. Please educate yourself. There is a great list of resources here: https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/k098s1/hey_ethfinance_lets_make_a_list_of_links/

I also recommend the [Bankless newsletter and podcast.](https://banklesshq.com/opportunities/) Their free stuff starting from the beginning is a great introduction to crypto and Ethereum (Personally, I think their first 8 or so podcast episodes are the best introduction).

Feel free to ask our friendly community any of your questions in the pinned r/ETHTrader community discussion post and the r/EthFinance daily discussion.

Finally, if you do just want to FOMO into ETH, Coinbase is probably the best option but services like PayPal also offer you price exposure (It's worth noting that if you're in a small or 3rd world country, the big name exchanges likely won't accept your currency so just find a local exchange instead. For example, Independent Reserve is a great exchange for Aus/NZ). However, as you learn more about crypto, you should take custody of your own crypto assets rather than trusting Coinbase or PayPal to hold your crypto. For that, check out the Argent wallet app on mobile app stores or buy a hardware wallet like a Ledger or Trezor but only buy them from the official websites.

***By the way, the crypto space is like going west in the frontier days. Opportunities to make money are everywhere but there are lots of bandits about. Be alert for scammers and never send anyone money because they claim to be doing a giveaway or because they say they have a trading program. They are lying and just want to take your money.***

One last piece of advice if you do buy ETH is to ignore price volatility in the short term. Crypto likes to go up and down 50% in a day sometimes. Don't let this bother you. This is a long term play and ignore short term volatility. This is easier said than done but scary 40%+ pull backs are the price you pay for such a big potential upside. Just keep calm and hold your crypto for years. Due to the scarcity of BTC and ETH you will be glad to hold onto it in the long term."

To me reaching ATH serves a better purpose than just profits, it will bring more developers into this space."

I feel like a better comparison would be to compare BTC against another store of value, like Gold or Silver, and maybe compare ETH against a commodity, maybe in the energy market like Oil.

2021-10-15,"Greetings, fellow investors. I'm writing this analysis as a friendly heads-up as to what might happen with the crypto market in the near future and why you shouldn't worry.  

If you like this analysis, please upvote my comment so I would be able to post in this subreddit from time to time - I really like it.  

  
Currently, we're experiencing stable growth in BTC price and Ethereum is at times outperforming BTC, marking a tendency we usually see some time before Altcoin Season starts, which is a great sign.
  

  
However, there's a pretty big possibility we might see another small crash soon, and here are the 3 reasons why this might happen:
  

  
The U.S Securities and Exchange Commission is set to approve the use of Bitcoin ETFs. This is amazing news for the crypto market, as institutions and corporations would have a regulated way to indirectly invest in Bitcoin (keep in mind, this is not the same as simply buying straight BTC), which would open a huge figurative floodgate, from which new money can flood the market long-term. However, the same may not apply in the short term. There's a Wall St. saying - ""Buy the Rumor, Sell the News"". If you're not familiar with it, it basically means ""Buy the hype and then sell just when the event happens"". A recent example of this is when Musk appeared on SNL to shill Dogecoin and the price soared just before the event but ended up tanking afterward. It's very likely that we may see the exact same scenario happen now. The media is hyping the ETFs, the price is soaring and we might see a steep drop when it actually happens. Of course, this drop would only be temporary, just like all the others but it's nice to know what might cause it, as to not despair and see it as a mere buying opportunity.
  

  
Some of the top BTC whales are selling amounts shy of 80\~ million USD. While some of them might be simply cashing out on their profits, some of these whales have a history of selling just before the market crashes. It's possible they themselves are trying to sell just before the ETF hits, so they can buy back in later at a lower price and increase their holdings. While this is not a 100% sure indicator of a market crash, it's nice to know it's happening, so you can anticipate the possibility of a crash.
  

  
This post is meant to provide you with information, so you can draw your own subjective opinions. It is merely advice to not despair, but to rather see the situation as a possible opportunity to fill your bag before the market finally pumps."

2022-03-12,"Jesus, these comments. 90% of this sub has no idea how markets or exchanges actually work, yet they throw accusations that OP is lying, or abused a bug.

No, flash crashes are not ""glitches"". Flash crashes occur when a market sell order that is larger, or a significant portion of the liquidity on the market occurs. Exchanges **do not share the same liquidity pools**, so flash crashes are more likely on smaller exchanges, like LAToken.

The price of XRP on any other exchange does not matter, the only thing that matters is the price of XRP on LAToken itself. You can literally go on LAToken and see that on 2/23/2022, the XRP>USDT market had a flash crash. It's still visible there.

Others were saying smart contracts will never come. I ended up selling at about $2.9. 

Sentiment when ADA was below $1 was ridiculously bad in this sub. Kind of ironic that people didn't accept it till after it hit ATH then they started shilling it. It goes in phases. Jealousy, anger, then acceptance. Acceptance always comes when its too late to make serious gains.

2022-11-19,"TVl is a product of coin value. I saw bitcoin at $ 200 survive mtGox hack. I saw a sub dollar btc rise  to 64k. I saw a 'shitcoin'(by btc maximalist rise to 4k) after collapsing from 1000 to sub 100, so this  is such a stupid take. Sol was under a dollar before market took off and around $2 before it REALLY took off. People who invested at right time are still in green and development is still happening. It's still at 6x from ico cost. 


It's possible that the solana just dies out, it's also possible that it'll rise same as eth did from last bear market. 

Anyone who claims to know how market will pan out in future is a Fucking moron. No one would have bet on eth claiming 4k mark after it collapsed from 1k+ to $89 in last cycle. And anyone who claims to know about coins in this cycle is a just a biased moron."

Time will tell but I’m still quite optimistic that SOL will do just fine without FTX, it’s hard to judge a coin when it’s a bear market. 

Anyway, I bought Solana when it was $5, sold most of them at around $200. Willing to keep a small bag and stake to see what happen in the future. For me, nothing to lose."
2022-11-19,So you’re saying that I should buy more $SOL?

>The Ethereum ecosystem has a resolute goal of being a stable and dependable system in the long run, but if you are here in Ethereum today, you should be here not because you believe the current rules (economic or technical) deserve to be protected and stabilized at all costs, but because you believe in where the ecosystem is going. In two years the main task will be to stabilize and cherish what we will have built. Until then, participation in Ethereum is unavoidably in part a prediction that the roadmap is a good one and that once this upgrading process ends we actually will get to a place where the network is efficient and stable and powerful and capable of being the base of significant parts of the global economy.

2021-02-04,"so, as someone brand new to crypto, it sounds like my best bet in regards to ETH is to get it if I'm gonna get it, and just not fuck with it to avoid dealing with high gas prices and whatnot."
2021-02-04,"There are several low-cost Ethereum L2s you can use, like [https://loopring.io](https://loopring.io), [https://zksync.io](https://zksync.io), [https://matic.network](https://matic.network) and [https://www.xdaichain.com/](https://www.xdaichain.com/), but the problem is you need to do an Ethereum L1 transaction to transfer your assets to them, and back again. That initial L1 transaction will cost $20 or more in ETH gas fees, so that prices out smaller users.

The good news is that now you can buy ETH with fiat and withdraw it directly to Matic, which is an Ethereum sidechain with \~zero transaction fees:

[https://beta-app.transak.com/](https://beta-app.transak.com/)

So this means there's no L1 transaction, and the associated gas fees, needed to start using ETH.

The problem is that Transak has a 40% mark up, so despite the gas savings from withdrawing directly to an Ethereum L2, it's not cost effective.

What's needed is

1. more cost effective exchanges, like Coinbase, providing options to withdraw ETH and ERC20 tokens directly to L2s, and
2. more low-cost bridges between L2s, and between L1 and L2, like what Connext is developing: [https://medium.com/connext/vector-0-1-0-mainnet-release-9496ae52c422](https://medium.com/connext/vector-0-1-0-mainnet-release-9496ae52c422)"

2021-02-04,Is there any trend in the time of the day that generally has lower transaction fees?
2021-02-04,Loopring added a ton of ERC assets yesterday personally one of my favorite L2 solutions.
2021-02-04,"How do you do a median transaction?

Also I think you are somewhat wrong in your assertion that people saying that fees are high are misinformed....fees are legitimately high. Practically all day today gwei was like 150 to 350 on eth gas station. It doesn't really help to say don't use dexes or smart contracts because there isn't a way around that for many things. (Granted you can use Looping but you have to first deposit your coins into L1 which costs a large amount anyway... Not really an answer for smaller holders of multiple coins...it would work if you were a large holder or if you know wanted to transact in a few coins...I actually think where L2 will make the biggest difference is when it's widely adopted so that L1 is much less congested which will in turn make depositing into L2 more reasonable). 

I understand that I'm competing with other transactions and that the network is super congested but I still don't really want to pay $40 just to approve the spending of [INSERT ERC20 TOKEN] on a smart contract and then another $100 to interact with that contract. I almost always set the gwei down very low on my transactions and never pay the initially suggested amount, but I can see a very concerning trend as a crypto dolphin even in the past 6 months. If I were a crypto newbie or crypto minnow I'd be saying fuck this... And we should all be worried about that"
2021-02-04,Don't forget to mention rollups!
2021-02-04,"Great explanation - wanted to add one thing on gas in case it helps someone understand

\> Gas prices are not the only thing in a transaction. When you think about a transaction, think about a car heading to a destination. Gas has a **price measured in ""Gwei""** which are simply units of ETH similar to satoshis, except 1b Gwei = 1ETH. The Gwei price is shown on [OP's same link](https://ethgasstation.info/) (which I recommend everyone to use), but ***transactions also have*** ***mileage***. Some of the $100+ transactions aren't always ""badly written"" as OP states, they might just be going really damned far.

That being said, OP is correct that sometimes you'll get some shitty ""directions"" that make your gas burn for 10 miles just to reach a destination 2 miles away.

I think analogies are easy for people to understand, I hope this helps someone.

tldr; Some smart contracts (e.g. staking protocols, advanced ERC-721 interactions, contractual agreements with terms and advanced interactions) actually are very expensive in terms of how much gas is required, but this (if anything) multiplies how important it is for you as a consumer to shop for gas at the rate you want it - it multiplies against distance in this case."
2021-02-04,"Hey, can someone tell me what the difference is between a smart contract and a regular transfer?"
2021-02-04,"In the short and mid term, layer 2 solutions will help a lot. Once the worst gas guzzlers like uniswap etc have moved to layer 2, the situation will relax a lot. I expect this all to happen in 2021. See also:

[https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698)

In particular the  with the OVM solution in which a project can move their smart contracts from layer 1 (EVM) to layer 2 (OVM) easily will help to move many of the defi projects.

  
I assume that tons of defi project have moved to layer 2 until summer 2021."

The amount of apy most staking projects are showing to you are complete and utter lies, create inflation that no one can control, and are Ponzi schemes that are claiming to create value out of thin air.

USD and Fed are guilty of doing the same thing, in a much larger scale. The difference is they have the legal framework and a loaning/borrowing ecosystem that tries to produce and intensives physical value to be created by it.

Yes selling at the bottom is stupid, not hodling leads to losses. But I know people that lost %90 of their investments still claiming to have faith in those investments.

I think you meant this as a negative, I think it's a positive. There are many coins that offer nothing new or useful. Some that offer solutions to problems that don't exist or do not require a blockchain. They're glorified lottery tickets. A bear that can wipe them out is doing the space a favor, not a disservice.

This sounds like a short-term retail investor - because investing is not supposed to be ""fun"" and dopamine triggering.

There's a reason for why it's generally advised to only invest in projects you plan on keeping for the next 5 years, and to only invest in money you can afford to lose.

So yes, if you do have conviction in the longevity of your investment then it is a benefit to be one-step ahead of the mainstream and accumulate as much of a holding as possible - and for as little money as possible."
2021-12-06,"1. A bear market will only last (at the longest) until the next Bitcoin halvening, 2.5 years from now. 😱

2. The media and mainstream financial sector are already calling crypto “rat poison” and a “bubble” or “fools gold”… how much worse could it get? lol

3. The coins which disappear in the bear market probably don’t have any use/utility anyway, it’s always a healthy clean out IMO. I won’t be sad to see Doggecoin die.

4. Bear markets are the BEST time to invest for the long term, and with the potential to make MASSIVE gains if chosen correctly and with conviction.

""First, the dollar bonds will likely get restructured, but most of the debt is in global mutual funds, ETFs, and some Chinese companies and not banks or other important financial institutions. Remember, Lehman Brothers was held on nearly all other financial institutions’ books, so not nearly as many institutions will be impacted by this versus Lehman.Secondly, we think the odds do favor the Chinese communist government will get involved should there be a default. They are holding out as of now, but the fallout could be too great for them to avoid intervening.Finally, Evergrande has tangible assets that can be sold off to settle financial obligations. Their assets aren’t great and creditors know that the company is in financial trouble , so the value of its assets aren’t likely worth as much as they think but it will still help settle some debts.

Doge is also a huge support for scrypt coins like LTC.

&#x200B;

>Why do I attack DOGE? Because I think it's a distraction for Crypto and damage its credibility.

This doesn't make sense. Doge is here to get people into crypto, to learn etc. If you have a problem with pump and dumps you can point that out with all the new shitcoins without blaming a very old currency around that was obviously rather a victim of the pump and dump than anything else.

To see a decrease in usage is probably also connected with rising prices. Doge was best when the price was stable, because it should rather be used as currency and not as investment. Also the rising price was in conflict with the fix fee of 1 Doge per kb TX size. This was also adjusted with the version 1.14.4 (fee is now 0.01 Doges per kb).

Adoption increased a lot, after plenty of shops that accept crypto added Dogecoin (coinbase commerce), etc."

We *thought* FTX was one of these saviors (after what happened after the Luna crash), but it turned out they aren’t - ironic."
2022-11-09,A reason is they use their FTT tokens as collateral to borrow USD to pump their coin and invest in their backed projects.
2022-11-09,FTX was a bad actor and it's good it collapsed now and not in the future when it was even bigger with the result of a even bigger fallout.

2022-11-09,"I'm no crypto expert, but just read on Wikipedia that FTX is incorporated in Antigua and Barbuda and headquartered in the Bahamas. This doesn't exactly inspire a lot of confidence in their corporate governance practices, internal controls, etc compared to companies registered in jurisdictions with more strict requirements. 

I'm not saying this is the only issue to consider when choosing an exchange, securities broker or any finacial intermediary, but I always prefer one registered in the US, EU, etc."
2022-11-09,"But you know what ? facts are boring and its more exciting for the morons of social media to say ftx was ‘brought down’ by a tweet, and not years of financial mismanagement and impropriety.

2022-11-09,"Important question though; does Binance do the same ? Their native token BNB is very very similar to what FTX has with FTT. 

Is there a cartwheel infinite money scheme on Binance as well ? 

Are they also acting like a bank and using customer funds ?"
2022-11-09,SBF even lied and said that have all customer assets available to withdrawal anytime. He said that just two days ago!
2022-11-09,"Call me naive, but why is it so unfeasible for exchanges to simply make money from charging fees to buy Fiat, conduct trades & withdraw Crypto & fiat?  

Why do they need to over-leverage themselves and gamble with our funds?  

There should be enough funds in an exchange so that if every user hit withdraw at the same time, nobody would be left high and dry.  

Is that naive of me? Is it just some deviant chasing of even-higher profits? Coinbase must make a fortune off crypto, can't they keep that safe for the low-volume months?  

I dunno. I don't like this (Chrissy wake up!)"

Uzi's involvement was crucial in marketing the NFTs which included promises of an exclusive performance which may or may not happen. He also mentioned in a deleted tweet that the NFTs, which minted for 2.5 SOL, would ""easily"" hit a floor of 6+ SOL in value.

To me this isn't even a rug pull scam, even though it's still a scam.  The NFTs still exist, but the value sank when Uzi appeared to start distancing himself from the project."

2021-03-25,"I think having regrets about not buying soon enough or selling to soon isn't any different from the regrets of any kind of missed opportunity, it's unfortunate it happened but crying over spilled milk is investing into feeling bad long term.

I remember I was around 16 when I first heard of bitcoin and I wanted to get some for my online games but couldn't ,at that time it was like 1 usd for 100 btc and first time they hit a few thousand I thought I should have made my parents buy me some(which they most likely wouldn't), but I didn't. Me and a friend even tried mining and would love to be able to recover those long lost accounts at the moment as even those scraps we had hold a decent value now.

So theoretically I had so many chances of getting rich until now, I probably missed on a lot of other opportunities as well, but what's in the past has already passed and the future is yet to be decided."

2021-03-25,"I hear these kind of things so often that it’s really annoying. Constantly “This guy spent Bitcoin ordering pizza - wuh oh!”

2022-01-27,"Avalanche or Polygon are not meant to be an “alternative to Ethereum”, at least, not as long as they are used through the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which operates in high gas fees.

But Avalanche has subnets, and they can work as separate blockchains per protocols, and transfer between subnets seamlessly. This is one of the fundamental developments of Avalanche; thus, we could have something like Defi Kingdoms in the future without it costing 1$ per transaction.

Polygon ~~is an L2~~ *(I stand corrected, Matic is a PoS compatible Ethereum side-chain)* and it’s not a competitor to Ethereum, it works alongside Ethereum. Once ETH merges, goes proof of stake and implements Sharding, or something like EIP4488 passes, to help with the congestion (short term) all EVM compatible chains are going to be much cheaper."

2021-05-01,"So the issue for low market cap coins is, how the hell are they meant to get noticed if it's not ""moonshot"" subreddits? A few people hate on these shill posts but it's literally the only way to get a coin noticed out here, otherwise what, you're just gonna mint it and hope someome just buys it off poocoin's ""Ape"" feature or on token.fomo

Always DYOR, look for coins with solid use cases, filter out the scams and only invest what you are willing to see fall to zero!"
2021-05-01,"I actually use thst subreddit as for project I should stay away from

If I hear a new coin I'm gonna look it up in that subreddit if a post exist yeah I should probably stay away."
2021-05-01,"Even though I agree with you 100%, I still made a shit ton of money from that subreddit. For context, I began investing in crypto almost 2 months ago with only 200$ and thanks to the memecoin hype I’ve made 11000$. Now I’ve relocated my gains to more sustainable cryptos for long term investing."
2021-05-01,"It was SAFEMOON that did it.  I don't know what it is about that project but it took off from Cryptomoonshots and left a path of destruction in it's wake.   

There are a lot of projects trying to be like Safemoon because safemoon made a lot of people a lot of money.... FOR NO REASON.  What use case does it have except some interesting tokenomics.  You make money just holding safemoon.  Now there are a million coins where you make money just holding it."
2021-05-01,"While i agree to stay far away from this sub and these kind of coins in general, those awards are most not awarded by bots.

It’s telegram groups that gets together and hype each other and comment with their multiple accounts as well as awards"
2021-05-01,The awards barely cost anything so people in the telegram buy them to make the post look more appealing
2021-05-01,"Maybe not fair to completely fair to blow all of them off as scams/will scam you, some are actually decent though often with more nontraditional naming. Some of them do actually end up as proper crypto further down the line and there is definitely people making money of it.

A high risk game within a sphere already considered high risk by many. A lot of them fail, a lot of them are too early to tell. Could it be fair to say it's essentially a betting game / gamling?

Personally I really dislike r/CryptoMoonShots because it's just a poorly run subreddit with as you pointed out a lot of automated low quality posts.  And IMO: In the same way as poker in a dodgy place might give you big gains (or loses) moonshots can, but it doesn't mean it's a good idea to go to there to begin with."
2021-05-01,Thing that get's me mad is that those fuckers are targeting young people/kids.
2021-05-01,"What hurts is that CryptoMoonShots used to be good. I found some good legit projects there at early entry points. Since Safemoon came along it has become a total shit show. Its eating itself alive now. Too many scams, too many burned investors."

I found some great projects there over the last 3 months, but last night I had $50 laying around and wanted to see how far they'll let it ride.

The ATO can get fucked, unless I can claim deductibles they ain't seeing a fucking cent."
2021-12-01,"The fact that the government can just decide to tax us despite not being involved with the risk of the investment at all is infuriating.

2021-12-01,"The opinions of the politicians (that it's worthless) don't create reality. Objectively cryptocurrency does have value. And thus they want their pound of flesh. 

Think of it this way - if you had a whole stack of beanie babies in the 90s and sold them for a cool milly they'd still want their tax on the gains. 

The vehicle for the transaction is irrelevant - the fact that you sold something for a gain is all that matters."

2021-08-03,"I'm from Spain and I highly doubt our government could even consider it lol. I think that if they do something is hyper regulate and squeeze as much taxes as they can from it. 

We are talking if a government that introduced a tax to Google to ""encourage"" digital transformation of the economy (they seriously sell it that way lol)

Also, PP is not the party in the government... It's PSOE (Spanish Labour Socialist Party). I feel this might something a minor PP politician said and they are doing click bait. Something like this would cause a huge social debate (with our government opposing as hard as they possibly can) and I haven't even heard about it until just now. I really wish that was the case but sadly Spain won't be a pioneer on anything positive anytime soon.

Edit: Found the original new, it looks like they proposed a bunch of stuff that sounds super technological and super cool like facial recognition, AI and Blockchain. Spoiler alert, they have no power nor probably understand anything of what they proposed."

Added: don't buy yet. The ripple effect is just starting and things will drop further. Don't sell at a loss right now, hodl if you can be patient.

The level of ignorance about the state of my country displayed in this comments might gave me an aneurysm so  to clear the air a little bit:


The protests are compounded of the following factors


- People who really don't want Bitcoin


- People who like Bitcoin but sees the implementation a absolute dog shit (I'm in this camp so I could elaborate further if requested)


- People who believe there are a thousand more pressing matters to solve instead of peddling the president's brother vanity project (also in this camp but irrelevant to the subject of the sub)


So you all need to stop pretending any criticism against btc implementation is a global conspiracy to bring you all down personally."
2021-10-08,"A bit conflicted here as a Salvadoran. To my knowledge, it’s recognized as optional legal tender and not enforced in any means whatsoever. Perhaps that large percentage of business aren’t recording crypto transactions simply because of it being an **OPTION** and not a requirement. Sure there are incentives, like discounted gasoline, which are tactics to increase adoption. As for identity theft: in order to register with Chivo wallet you must use either your passport or DUI which are, in my opinion, supposed to be be kept safe by the individual. Yes, identify theft can still occur, but I would need better statistics regarding identity theft prior to and post legal tender. I must also say that I’ve plenty of times seen even poor folks, even the worst of Cantones, place importance on gadgets like smartphones over basic clothing, so I’ve witnessed even poor folks with access to a smartphone. It would then be their choice to use Chivo. The benefits I’ve seen all relate to remittances and less wealthy folks dealing with lower or non existent fees. All in all, no rollout is smooth especially when you’re the first country doing it. There are bound to be mistakes. Hopefully it improves over time and that there be a bit more transparency between the government and the people. Hope for a prosperous and stable 🇸🇻"

2021-10-08,"I've said this a few times, the conversation of el salvador and bitcoin (on this sub) has been over simplified with no regard of the country's history of dysfunctional politics. social political implications are overlooked to prioritize the focus of crypto.

I'm salvadoran diaspora, born here in the US so I'm no where near as versed in the current events going on in the country. But regardless, I appreciate a post like this that attempts to bring nuance to the table - in addition to helping me tune my perception of what's going on back home.

It really goes without saying, I think that most salvadorans have a similar anxiety about the integrity of the government (read up on our history, a civil war desecrated our political landscape). This of course effects the sentiment on bitcoin. I am extremely disappointed in the abundance of people in this thread calling fud. I think we ought to hold some space for the complexity of what is going on here, if only adoption were so easy. The points that OP brought up are not very sensational but perhaps more context is needed for outsiders to understand."

I'm assuming you read the best of a few days ago which linked to this

**Edit: well known post 
https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/fxgi06/not_new_news_but_tbh_if_you_have_tiktiok_just_get/fmuko1m/**

I'm getting together the data now and enlisted the help of my colleagues who were also involved in the RE process. We'll be publishing data here over the next few days: https://np.reddit.com/r/tiktok_reversing/. I invite any security folk who have the time to post what they've got as well - known domains and ip addresses for sysadmins to filter on, etc. I understand the app has changed quite a bit in recent versions, so my data won't be up to date.

I understand there's a lot of attention on this post right now, but please be patient.

So I can personally weigh in on this. I reverse-engineered the app, and feel confident in stating that I have a very strong understanding for how the app operates (or at least operated as of a few months ago).

TikTok is a data collection service that is thinly-veiled as a social network. If there is an API to get information on you, your contacts, or your device... well, they're using it.

Phone hardware (cpu type, number of course, hardware ids, screen dimensions, dpi, memory usage, disk space, etc)
Other apps you have installed (I've even seen some I've deleted show up in their analytics payload - maybe using as cached value?)
Everything network-related (ip, local ip, router mac, your mac, wifi access point name)
Whether or not you're rooted/jailbroken
Some variants of the app had GPS pinging enabled at the time, roughly once every 30 seconds - this is enabled by default if you ever location-tag a post IIRC
They set up a local proxy server on your device for ""transcoding media"", but that can be abused very easily as it has zero authentication
The scariest part of all of this is that much of the logging they're doing is remotely configurable, and unless you reverse every single one of their native libraries (have fun reading all of that assembly, assuming you can get past their customized fork of OLLVM!!!) and manually inspect every single obfuscated function. They have several different protections in place to prevent you from reversing or debugging the app as well. App behavior changes slightly if they know you're trying to figure out what they're doing. There's also a few snippets of code on the Android version that allows for the downloading of a remote zip file, unzipping it, and executing said binary. There is zero reason a mobile app would need this functionality legitimately.

On top of all of the above, they weren't even using HTTPS for the longest time. They leaked users' email addresses in their HTTP REST API, as well as their secondary emails used for password resets. Don't forget about users' real names and birthdays, too. It was allllll publicly viewable a few months ago if you MITM'd the application.

They provide users with a taste of ""virality"" to entice them to stay on the platform. Your first TikTok post will likely garner quite a bit of likes, regardless of how good it is.. assuming you get past the initial moderation queue if thats still a thing. Most users end up chasing the dragon. Oh, there's also a ton of creepy old men who have direct access to children on the app, and I've personally seen (and reported) some really suspect stuff. 40-50 year old men getting 8-10 year old girls to do ""duets"" with them with sexually suggestive songs. Those videos are posted publicly. TikTok has direct messaging functionality.

Here's the thing though.. they don't want you to know how much information they're collecting on you, and the security implications of all of that data in one place, en masse, are fucking huge. They encrypt all of the analytics requests with an algorithm that changes with every update (at the very least the keys change) just so you can't see what they're doing. They also made it so you cannot use the app at all if you block communication to their analytics host off at the DNS-level.

For what it's worth I've reversed the Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter apps. They don't collect anywhere near the same amount of data that TikTok does, and they sure as hell aren't outright trying to hide exactly whats being sent like TikTok is. It's like comparing a cup of water to the ocean - they just don't compare.

tl;dr; I'm a nerd who figures out how apps work for a job. Calling it an advertising platform is an understatement. TikTok is essentially malware that is targeting children. Don't use TikTok. Don't let your friends and family use it.
Edit: Well this blew up - sorry for the typos, I wrote this comment pretty quick. I appreciate the gold/rewards/etc people, but I'm honestly just glad I'm finally able to put this information in front of people (even if it may outdated by a few months).

If you're a security researcher and want to take a look at the most recent versions of the app, send me a PM and I'll give you all of the information I have as a jumping point for you to do your thing.

Edit 2: More research..

2022-01-12,"I think we need someone to come along and completely reinvent how crypto wallets and transfers work to get money in and out of the banking system easily.  These exchanges, QR codes, private, public keys, staking, etc... is all very foreign to most people.

It needs to be rethought from a human centered design perspective and make it so simple that anyone can do it without fear of their money get lost, hacked, stolen, etc.  Then Mass adoption.

Edit: I also wanted to add that most people dont invest in the stock market or do exchange trading, so while I think they are getting better, there needs to be a ultra simplistic UI for most people to convert their currencies that doesn't feel like being part of exchange floor on Wall St."
2022-01-12,"Once you will be able to interact with blockchain without knowing the App is running on blockchain.

That’s my “mass adoption” milestone."
2022-01-12,"I think you’re looking at this all wrong.

Crypto and blockchain technology isn’t a consumer product like an iPhone — that will revolutionise and dominate the market.

Meaning, it’s a means to an end and not the end itself.

It’s a technology and a more accurate comparison would be to compare blockchains to coding languages (C++, Python, PHP, Java, etc etc etc) — which all co-exist fine with each other, each having a specific use case.

Same for blockchains.

You really don’t need the “iPhone” of crypto because chances are each cryptocurrency will end up being used for one specific purpose; rather than be a universal product that people will use for everything.

Edit: Some people have (correctly) pointed out that a better analogy would be to think of blockchains as operating systems and crypto currencies as apps on your computer OS.

I like that analogy because who would use Microsoft Word to edit a photo?

You obv would use Photoshop."
2022-01-12,"I think Crypto.com are sort of on the right track with a pre-paid visa. 

If the likes of Trezor or Ledger take a step into this ground, allowing you to spend whatever coins you assign to a card linked to the wallet, then the ease of use comes along with security. 

I don’t know how it would work exactly, but when I can just set up auto-investment every month, and then use that to buy my weekly food shop, take out, or car fuel, we’re there. 

So regardless of whether I buy the top 10 coins only, or #1377 shit coin, if it’s useable in a shop then we’re almost living underwater in the year 3000."

If gas fees wouldn’t be such a big variable, that would be nice. If there was some sort of safeguard to avoid money from disappearing into thin air by sending to a wrong wallet or network, etc."

2022-01-12,That’s the whole game. Pick coins and hope they become the “it” coin.
2022-01-12,"Your right, we are still in the 'blackberry' phase of the adoption and the iPhone hasnt come out yet, once that happens we will all be retiring."
2022-01-12,I can’t be the only one who doesn’t see mass adoption ever. Why would the masses need crypto?
2022-01-12,"I think you're right, and I believe that end is the purpose that art NFTs are serving right now... they're trying to be retail type products that people can buy and sell easily, but it's often a pain in the ass and lots of hiccups in many cases (not as much in the aftermarket, but more so in the minting phase).

Those hiccups, and the friction, networks fees, etc will force companies and chains to make improvements and eventually one or two chains and/or purchase enablement companies will nail it. They'll make it fast, easy and cheap. In the early days, they may even disguise the crypto nature under the hood as local currency in the user view because that's one less thing for the average person to get comfortable with.

Once the tech is fast, easy and cheap, then you need to get the retailers on board. The crypto marketplaces will adopt it first of course, and then the traditional retailers will start coming on board very quickly when they realize that chargebacks are not possible and the service fees are much lower than they're paying with visa/debit (network/service fees are less than one cent on some chains). Those two things could make a huge difference in profitability for a lot of companies and that will highly motivate them to join.

In a crypto world, I believe the purchaser will end up paying the network fee on transactions. That's already true, but I mention it because it's a departure from the Debit/Credit world where the retailer pays the service fee. 

Lastly, I think there is a huge need for ""credit"" in the crypto world right now, but for a different reason than in traditional retail. There can sometimes be a long delay between the time you want to buy something with crypto and the time it takes to get more fiat into crypto or exchange other coin/token into the coin/token that you want to use. If instant credit was available, that could allow you to make a crypto payment immediately while waiting to settle that debt by getting more fiat into cyrpto or transferring/converting another coin/token over. This need may go away if some chain or solution provider makes a solution that is fast and easy enough to get money into the proper chain in time for your purchase window. This is exacerbated by art NFTs and other assets that sell out in minutes -- there is no time to wait to buy. I also recognize that ""credit"" brings some of the problems of traditional finance that we're trying to get rid of, but it may help bridge the transition from cenfi to defi."
2022-01-12,ETH is the “aol” of crypto
2022-01-12,The largest individual shareholder of Apple is the new GameStop chairman Ryan Cohen. He is developing a NFT marketplace for GameStop. I am sure he understands and values cryptos which he will support for Apple to adapt with. It’s just a matter of time in my opinion.
2022-01-12,"That's also the true adoption I think is needed. Until Crypto is made as easy as online banking currently is, we won't have mass adoption. In fact it will need to be easier than online banking to really take off. 

So the day my sweet old mum is able to transfer 1 BTC without having to ring me to help her do it will be the day we truly have adoption and use."
2022-01-12,It’s never going to get mainstream adoption until the fees get sorted out. Nobody’s gonna wanna use the blockchain if every interaction costs money.

The Ethereum fork is a stupid comparison. There is nothing Solana could do to fix this as the Wormhole bridge is not under their control, the ETH are locked on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is the network should be forked, but why would they do it for someone else's mistakes?

Check out ICP token from Dfinity foundation. Not only everything is hosted on chain. (yes everything. frontend + backend), not needing an oracle because ICP has successfully implemented HTTPS calls on the blockchain.

And users that visited and used the web page powered by ICP doesn't have to pay any transaction fees at all. Users just have to create an account like how they normally did on web2. And that's it! It doesn't even feel like is on web3 because of how fast ICP is!

The worst aspect is significantly more dangerous and stupid, to the point that it's clear Elon either has no fucking idea what he's talking about and is legitimately no-thoughts-head-empty, or he's a sociopath who doesn't see these as problems.

What I'm talking about is the implications of turning a social media platform into a blockchain. Because what happens if someone doxxes another person, or posts stolen nudes or revenge porn, or posts *child porn* to the chain? You can't scrub that like a normal centralized system can. Once it's out there, it's done forever unless you manage to do a fork/rollback, but you'd have to do that every single time someone posted illegal content to your platform. You'd need to have some truly infallible system of manual reviews of all content that gets posted which isn't feasible, or you'd need to have some way to decouple the log of transactions to tweet from the content of tweets themselves which would always circle back around to needing a centralized database, negating the entire ""purpose"" of using a blockchain for social media to begin with.

2022-09-30,"I think it's great idea but could be better.

First users should get  +1 DOGE every time someone liked a tweet of theirs.
On top of that every few days there was a free badge that gave both user DOGE and whoever we chose to gave it to rewarding user who make good tweets.
Then only user with super low DOGE cannot post usually newer user or Bots.

Also just keep Twitter 100% free. Instead of DOGE it will be a useless internet point that can never be tuned into  money and instead of charging these points per post users just need to maintain a minimum point balance to post. That way it doesn't get taken over by bots hyper farming DOGE."

I don't expect many governments to become long term investors in crypto.  They would be more likely to convert to fiat and combine it with their other funds.

Many governments already report how their budgets break down and their summary tax collections.  So, net effect would be very little additional transparency from the government side."

So even when people are clued up even a little bit, they still don't use that information usefully.  

There are scandinavian countries that are a lot more transparent about where taxation funds are spent. They tend to do a lot of public office stuff very well in countries like Denmark, Norway etc."

Actual crypto/NFT integration will not be ""investments"". It will simply be a new way for players to own items they get in games and trade them with other players.

So I can completely understand Steam banning games with crypto for now. They will have to first work on some rules of what kind of integration even makes sense before letting every scam project on their platform.

The crypto community is right in that NFTs could unleash entirely new game designs and empower players. But the gaming community is right in that almost all blockchain-based games right now are just poorly designed, unfun games at best and scams at worst.

Instead of telling gamers ""NGMI"" or whatever, what we should be doing is pushing game developers using this technology to be better. Ownership of assets isn't a compelling video game feature to build around, yet that's all NFT games talk about it. The focus should be on creating great, engaging games - selling assets, earning money, etc. should be secondary to the gameplay experience.

Most gamers don't care one way or another about NFTs, but they do care about games being broken, unfun and pay-to-win. Make a good game first and they'll see the value of ownership."

Could have just been that coinmarketcap updated their API, could have been that they had old exchanges listed that they finally removed. Could be an error on CMC's side. Could be that they don't support certain exchanges anymore.

>“As far as I can tell $USDD is not an algorithmic stablecoin. The only interaction that the TRD members can do is to burn TRX to get USDD. I see no contract to go the other way, and no algorithm adjusting either mechanism, except that minting depends on oracle price of TRX. Like nominally the algorithm in Terra was the mechanism which refilled the AMM in the market module (they lied about this a bunch). This doesn’t seem to have an algorithm at all!”

So essentially an algorithmic stablecoin like USDD may be viable if Tron doesn’t make the same mistake?"

2022-03-31,"Crypto at the moment creates more problems than it solves for a average person. Imagine if someone had to buy something at it had only crytpo as payment, I think average person with no crypto knowledge would just look for an alternative option. Noone wants to be forced into innovation, organical growth is necessary for crypto to succeed."
2022-03-31,"That’s probably the biggest challenge of Crypto. Get the normal person to understand why it’s useful for them.

I can easily explain to my Grandma that the Internet is just like a big library, but in her computer, or that she can connect her headphones with her computer via Bluetooth, to hear music. She would totally see the point and convenience in those technologies.

However…Crypto? Or Bitcoin? 
„yeah, it’s like money, but there is no central institution you have to trust. Oh, you also have to register on some exchange, potentially do KYC, buy some of many many coins, and then you have to take those coins away from the exchange, on your wallet - ideally paper wallet or hardware wallet which you have to buy for 50$ - and then be sure to store your wallet somewhere safe. Also, if you loose it your money is gone!“

I think my grandma would have exploded right there.

Most people don’t see the value decentralization holds. And most people are just fine with their banks and fiat. It works for them, they don’t have to bother much, and also they are not responsible if something happens. Not everyone needs the responsibility crypto provides in order to manage everything yourself

Creating obviously convenient applications are what brings the people. Imagine some true decentralized election system with no possibility of fraud. Everyone would love that and easily see the benefits of it"
2022-03-31,"Most crypto investors don't know how it works either. Most just buy and hold a token, never using it to pay for services provided by the blockchain. Indistinguishable from a trendy low cap stock to most people at this point."
2022-03-31,[removed]
2022-03-31,"It's not even the operation that matters. If we can show one use case to the end user that they will use then we have an investor and regular user.

A case study is the UPI or Unified Payment Interface in India. Uptil that point, all internet transactions were based on bank transfers. but with the introduction of UPI, everyone now could send money from one bank account to another. 

As with all internet based money transfer, servers are usually not able to keep up and there are some dropped transactions. Nor is it unlimited with a limit of 100,000 Indian Rupees per day. But today it is the most popular and most used payment system used from the smallest of street vendors to the largest of corporations. Reason ? NO FEES

That alone was enough to get people to risk sending through spotty internet connection. Further the ease of setting up, sending and recieving using UPI was also a major reason for attracting small scale businesses.

But does anyone know how UPI works ? Not really. Nor do they even understand what they are doing at every step. They just blindly follow the steps of entering amount, pin, send and done. Thats all

Make a technology that even someone illiterate can use and you have something that everyone will adopt"
2022-03-31,"**Problem**

The problem with Blockchain is it's become a buzzword.  It also doesn't help that snake oil tech uses it as a ""revolutionary"" technology and muddies the water.

While you don't need to understand it, the average person needs to understand what it does for them and that, generally, isn't clear to them.

**Solution**

There needs to be an elevator pitch for what Blockchain does for the average person and it needs to come from a source they trust.  That means a 30 second explanation of what it does for them and how to use it.

None of these deep dive YouTube videos or lengthy epistles explaining everything Blockchain.  Just the quick this is what it does for the average person"
2022-03-31,"Exactly, I fully agree. In fact, I think it discourages people from learning about blockchain rather than encourages them (""oh no, just another fancy new technology that everyone will forget about in a minute smh"").

People need to unconsciously start using crypto that is adopted in large-scale industries.

This is already happening in some industries, such as ticketing, which has recently started to adopt NFT to a serious degree. You don't need any knowledge of NFT and blockchain to take advantage of all the benefits of this solution. And projects like GET Protocol have already sold over 1,500,000 NFT tickets to non-crypto savvy people.

This is true adoption."
2022-03-31,"I understand everything about it. I have my own software company.

Which is why I'm not adopting it. It solves no problems. None."
2022-03-31,When do we get to the utility part?
2022-03-31,People still dont understand how computers or Internet works and here we are.
2022-03-31,"Agree, BUT they do need to understand some of the UX designs. Crypto suffers from a huge problem which is that most design seems like it's being created by engineers, and it's just not intuitive for the average person."
2022-03-31,"Decentralisation will not work as the world has to cater for the lowest common denominator. 

There needs to be centralised systems like a bank/binace card/crypto.com/nexo where they provide a card/wallet and transactions are as easy as banking.

2022-03-31,"This just isn’t true. Utility on a decentralized blockchain isn’t going to be inherently better than the centralized solutions so for people to want to adopt crypto they need to understand why it benefits them to have something that’s not fiat, that not centralized.  If they don’t understand that then they’ll forever stick to stuff like Venmo or Zelle."

2021-05-19,"I don't agree with some of the assumptions in here, but still a great analysis & definitely some good points made. Thank you for all the effort that went into this, quality post.

One of the things that most concerns me is the massive amount of debt that's built up. I've really been thinking a lot about which scenario is most likely. I feel like this bubble is so big, and there's so much on the line, that the fed can't 'pop' it anymore without it forming a very very large systemic risk. For example, housing prices have gone through the roof where I live. Mainly because of the extremely low interest rates... now, would this bubble pop, this would pose a **massive** risk to the banking sector because of the amount of loans that would never be paid back. So banks now have interest in continually propping up the housing market. Same with countries - interest rate can't go up, because countries are now in so much debt that repaying it would be catastrophic or SUPER inflationary (as they turn on the printing press to repay). So it's in their best interest to keep inflation high and interest low - debase the currency to pay back debts. This is where I see crypto in my portfolio - a hedge against the systemic risk that seems to be lurking. A digital version of gold, in that we don't need the legacy finance system to work for me to hold it, much like hard physical goods or real estate.

IF they are going to pop the bubble, that'll be painful...  but I feel like that would pose such a significant threat to the system, that I'd take btc or gold over fiat any day..."

2021-05-19,"The answer is simple. Many large financial institutions were participating in short selling Game Stop into bankruptcy. They were extremely over leveraged in their margin positions and are now completely fucked. Margin calls and bankruptcies are just around the corner. You can look at the charts and see many syncronized liquidations of every major crypto that have happened since January. They have been bleeding out all of their money in hopes that everyone gives up and forgets about it, trying to buy as much time as they can. The major hit we saw today in the crypto market coincides precisely with a new rule that the SEC recently added to the stock market (among others). Anyone who held a large short position had to come up with money by 9 a.m. today. Crypto bottomed out just before 9. I know this sounds like i have my tinfoil wrapped too tightly around my head but i believe that this is what caused the dip. $GME go BRRRR 🚀"

2021-07-03,"Your post is golden.

I'm old...hell this account on reddit may have been started when some of you were in high school or even elementary school. 

I can't explain how different the world was before smart phones. The world has changed far more from cell phone to smart phone then land line dominace to cell phones.

One day I noticed everyone was walking around with their Nokia....and slowly the old emergency phones started disappearing from the side of freeways as quickly as pay phones.

Smart phones were the main reason we switched to Web 2.0. Cell phones were nice, we saved on long distance calls and became more connected....but when smart phones took over I feel it changed the very fabric of our social life. For me...it feels like yesterday--the mid aughts getting my first text and wondering why they just didn't email...and the sense of future shock when my buddy showed me the new iPhone. 

That was back in 07...just 14 years ago.

If you had shown me our world.....kids recording and releasing albums on Spotify, Tik Tokers becoming millionaires..fucking onlyfans...I would think it impossible to have such a dramatic change so quickly. My granny still doesn't have a DVD player but she does have an iPhone. People burning less then a minute of boredom at the traffic light, the almost complete eradication of digital cameras and camcords...entire businesses launched and ran on a phone...it would just seem impossible to see such change in a little more then a decade.

I back projects because in my half a century of time on earth I have seen how technology accelerates cultural change far beyond what the intended use was of the hardware.

But I refuse to live through again what it feels like to be on reddit 11 years ago and read about BTC not long after it was created....even finally seeing it as more then a way to buy weed on the SR as I first was exposed to crypto.....even dip my toe in and make a buy in late 17 but never really learning about cryoto. I'm DCAing and will let another decade flow by (if I'm blessed with more years)....maybe I will look back at this post in 10 years and laugh at myself. Who knows....but maybe.......just maybe.........you know the rest."

But on the chance it’s not actually anything useful and it stagnates, your retirement isn’t fucked because you bet everything on a extremely risky bet."
2021-07-03,I’ve been thinking this a lot lately. Everything is currently so awkward and clumsy and un-intuitive but that will change w time. Right now the developers are perfecting the technology. Once they do they’ll focus more on convenience so it can be widely adopted. Does anyone remember the internet before “www”? I didn’t use it back then but I hear tales about how hard it was to navigate the internet before the World Wide Web was a thing. The internet of the 80s is a far cry from the internet of today. The exact same thing will happen w crypto. Even dumb stuff like having to send yourself a $0 transaction to claim your interest on Algo if you’re using ledger. It’s not a huge deal but that kind of awkward stuff will slowly disappear and as it does the general public will start to adopt it. A decade ago Amazon was a small fraction of retail. I read recently that over 50% of all internet sales are on Amazon. That’s an insane adoption rate if you actually think about it

2021-07-05,"I think you have good points. Essentially if you don't know how to browse etherscan.io and find the contract and read it. Or decompile the byte code and be able to read it. You should look for projects that have security audits done on their smart contracts and be very wary of so many projects trying to pump and rug pull.

I find smart contracts to be amazing."
2021-07-05,What does the average person do with this information tho? I've always outright ignored the technical stuff because I couldn't understand it if I wanted to. I'm not a developer or a lawyer so lol
2021-07-05,"Is the code in a smart contract human-readable, or can it be deployed in a compiled or obfuscated state?

Basically, can backdoors be semi-hidden behind opaque code?"
2021-07-05,a smart contract is a contract that is not stupid
2021-07-05,There is so much of hype and exaggeration surrounding blockchain and cryptocurrencies that truth has been hidden behind high tech phraseology that keeps evolving with each passing day. Smart contracts and chaincode are the names for a piece of computer code and immutability is nothing but a farcical and fanciful term. Blockchain is yet another database and peope have seen immutablility fly in the air when whole coins and chains evaporated overnight. Cryptocurrencies have given rise to a new moral (or immoral) where it's OK to hussle by using pump and dump as a tactic. The unaware as always be the losers and the wicked the winners. Pardon me if I sound sore. I am a blockchain developer and know things can be done with greater moral values and more ethically.
2021-07-05,So it's like the marriage contract. It doesn't magically make everything perfect or solve all your problems.
2021-07-05,Are smart contracts a way to store medical history or am I  thinking of something else?

It’s a long line of people who would love to scoff and jeer and I have nothing to offer back in reply. I choose not to engage. So I wait. One of two things will occur. It will dip harder. And the masochistic pragmatic in me wants to buy at bargain basement prices. I want it to moon certainly. Just…..not quite yet. The more I buy the more I want to buy. And I keep thinking if this coin will only dip to here then my DCA will be here. But crypto is like a boiling kettle it’s going to blow and be life changing over night…..someday very soon. I’m just not quite done playing robber-baron. I look at BTC and think if only I had loaded up back then. Well, today is tomorrows “back then”.

2022-02-16,"I gave up on this sub a long time ago, and it basically boils down to moon farming having destroyed any quality posts/comments. Make a serious comment pointing out factual stuff, get ignored or downvoted (if it contradicts inaccurate hyperbole being posted), but if you post some utterly stupid comment then you get all the upvotes and recognition.

If we want this sub to actually be worth more than the pile of shit MOONS everyone is after, then we need to get rid of MOONS. I won't take this sub seriously until that happens."

2022-02-16,"This sub needs to provide more value to new investors. The about page should be filled with resources and trainings about responsibly owning and mining crypto. Instead this subreddit is used to pump and dump coins and screw over its own members.

Look at what superstonk does to funnel users to take a single action, register their GME shares. A similar focus on educating people on several key bullet points like how to keep crypto safely off exchanges, how to safely send and receive crypto, and how to safely invest it would help the subreddit and crypto space I believe.

2022-06-02,"just a question of how you want to spin the narrative.

the blockchain is law and is the identity of a coin. In that sense, Luna is dead. 

Luna2 is a new project, where the developers of the failed project promise to make it better this time. In a best-case-scenario, they try to make it up for those that lost money. In a worst-case-scenario, they try to trick them again.

So luna 2 is a new project that needs new evaluation to determine whether investing is a smart move or not. Given the history of the developers, how it was rushed and how competence does not seem to be a driving factor behind the project, I would say there is no reason to throw money at it. Independent of whether people lost money on lunac before or not. Independent of whether the developers just fail at making a good project or succeed in making a scam.... just does not seem like a good project in itself."

""We further allege that Ms. Ellison and Mr. Wang played an active role in a scheme to misuse FTX customer assets to prop up Alameda and to post collateral for margin trading. When FTT and the rest of the house of cards collapsed, Mr. Bankman-Fried, Ms. Ellison, and Mr. Wang left investors holding the bag. Until crypto platforms comply with time-tested securities laws, risks to investors will persist.

Instant moon🚀🚀🚀"
2021-12-30,Everyone is genius in a bull market
2021-12-30,"I had partially done this myself, checking his suggestions in old videos and viewing their performance.

He has improved over time which is encouraging but I can't get over the fact that in some videos he recommends X whilst not buying it himself as his portfolio holds other coins. I can understand how praising BTC & ETH attracts less viewers than talking about riskier options and mooncoins but still, I find it lacking in integrity. For example, Terra Luna, he has praised it often yet never bought it himself. I don't understand the logic in that so I'm cautious in his suggestions. 

Anyway, he's a good source for information and the fact that he shares his portfolio in his weekly newsletter is refreshing and a solid, easy option for newcomers to imitate. Just threw some thoughts out there as a relative newcomer myself."
2021-12-30,"We probably shouldn't underestimate the effect his video has on pumping a specific project. As soon as someone youtubes/googles that project, his video with all his subscribers etc pops up, likely instilling immediate confidence."
2021-12-30,Every coin pumped in 2021.....lol
2021-12-30,So Coin Bureau doesn't know shit about fuck either and gets lucky just like us?
2021-12-30,"Great analysis, thanks for the high quality informative post!"
2021-12-30,"Keep in mind Coin Bureau’s platform is based on education, explanation, and guidance it is not financial advise lol. Guy doesn’t claim nor have the Midas touch but tries to present the info in a clear concise and actionable manner for the lay man to understand. Also kinda shitty your downplaying his contribution to the space and calling his viewers too lazy to DYOR because they chose CB to provide them actionable info. While I agree everyone should DYOR first off we both know that most do not read one word of a white paper before tossing money at things. Random ass shit coins and rug pulls are direct examples of this. IMO atleast CB is not trying to take active advantage of his viewer base like most in his space are. Additionally, you do realize your conclusion seems like an attempt to diminish his findings because of the lack of time frame and data when most of the projects / tracts are about the same age right? Apart from btc / eth and very very few others, many tokens / coins are new projects that weren’t originally around in the initial bull / bear cycle. And once again none of his videos are investment advice…. 

Along those lines, we both know diversification is the name of any investment game so IMO comparing profitability of xyz coin to eth and btc is probably unwise at best since it constitutes a portion of your portfolio as store of value / hedge within the space. 

Performance evaluation is an exercise in understanding a clients risk tolerance, so as the composite man steps fully into the space we all need to recognize that he’s going to be trying to achieve similar gains like Mr. Wonderful has outlined in many a podcast. 
 

TLDR: As far as educational content goes, his approach and evaluation practices of projects / ecosystems has some merit. Guy is about as straight shooting as you can get from a YouTuber / crypto Degen IMO. Don’t hate the player hate the game and DYOR. 

Oh and one last tidbit: The more things change the more they stay the same"

Wont take the time to go out and buy them. This isn’t Coinbase where it’s simple click and buy, you have to go through a bunch of extra steps. The reason you saw SHIB or Doge pump so hard *after* being listed on these big exchanges is for that exact reason. So the people getting rug pulled on those aren’t “complete” noobs and know at least a little something above your average person."

It's currently trading at $7.20 on OKx after hitting a low of $5 about an hour ago, so somebody else could post about how it's up >40% in the last hour which I'm sure you would find ridiculous, even though it's true.  

What the market truly values it at won't be known until more exchanges have listed it and more liquidity is available - but like you, I also expect it to drop - once trust is lost it's not easily won back."

I have a hard time looking at any cryptocurrency as more than the house of cards that LUNA obviously has been shown to be. What is most clear, to me at least, is that the old web2 crowdfunding concept of sending out a plea and asking people for money ...really works when it comes to catchy, make that kitschy, crypto projects. All you really need to do is have some coding know-how, make a coin from thin air, and market it - then sit back and watch as various and sundry folks drop hard earned fiat into a digital wallet and buy up the shitcoins. Call me cynical. And I hope instead of downvotes I get a bunch of knowledgeable folks making wiser comments than these because I would surely like to be proven to be incorrect in my conclusions and estimations about the crypto sphere. Until then, though, I'll keep my remaining fiat in the traditional bank, secure in the knowledge that the FDIC insures every penny and I can't lose what I've deposited. GOOD LUCK Y'ALL

EDIT: I have steadily built a large portfolio in crypto. I am down over 60%. I continue to hold all coins and tokens even the LUNA. But I dearly hope to see some losses pared and the market recover so I can sell out of all but a few, namely BTC, ETH, ATOM, ADA, ALGO and a few others"

Think about it like this. I make new crypto with 10 coins. I buy all ten for $10. The new market cap is $10 and coin is $1/coin. I sell one coin to my friend for $2. Market cap is up ""100%"" on the volume of $2. My friend sells it for $30/coin. Now the market cap is $30/coin \* 10 = $300 total but the 24-hour change is up from $1->$30 -> 2900%

By all the coins, I'm referring to the ones I'm holding and a few others that I checked.

Robinhood is not that bad. Especially for the newest waves of crypto investors.  It certainly served its purpose for me. When I was ready to go deeper, I did. And believe me I did. Not just in research but in investment. Big time. 

Don’t ever underestimate the value of simplicity and practicality. It’s fundamental for mainstream adoption. 


Lastly, no fees and a $10 spread on a $50k buy is a fucking STEAL. Not sure you’ve done big trades before. Wait till you see fees on defi and wallet transfers. Let alone the cumulative fees you pay on make/take via exchanges.

All brokerages have down times, and having used multiple I can honestly say robinhood is probably one of the better one lately.

And why are you talking about the bid ask spread as like it’s some sort of evil thing? How else is a company supposed to make money? It’s literally a free app the fuck lol.  Once again, every service saying it’s “free” does exactly the same thing, but I guess strike is good guy, robinhood is bad guy 😂

Reddit always needs a boogie man. All the apes like to pretend that the big boys are always plotting against us when the truth is always more boring.

I've had so many people close to me get into crypto this year and not a single one of them listens to me about keeping coins on an exchange or using apps like robinhood.

Even a really close friend of mine who is now like heavily invested is still holding all his coins on exchanges, I have spent so much time explaining to him how to use a wallet and all that other good stuff, recently he accidentally sent matic into Celsius from ku coin using the matic network and lost his tokens.  We are in the process of trying to get them back but at the end of the day, it is his fault.

  I have lectured him endlessly on how to use ethereum and he knows he could have asked me for help if he was confused but it's like people just zone out and all those important instructions go right in one ear and out the other.

I feel like this is also a big barrier to adoption,  we live in an echo chamber, most people don't want control ... they want it simple and idiot proof mode.  I can't tell you how many other friends I told not to keep coins on robinhood because you don't actually own them and all they say is ""good, all that other stuff sounds way to complicated"".

2021-12-02,"So that's not actually how the fractional reserve system works. It's a model of understanding often taught at certain levels in economics but it isn't the real thing (It's like the Bohr model of the atom in physics). Real monetary macroeconomics is... complicated, but I'd start by saying that the lending itself creates the money, rather than some of the money subsequently being lent.

Why does this matter? Because when you get a better handle on what (fiat) money is and move away from derivatives of money as a tokenised claim on precious metal, you understand what makes it real. Money is debt and the underlying value of that debt comes from the nation that underwrites it with a claim on a rate of goods, labour, natural resources or acceptance for taxation.

Most have a central bank that will give you some idea of what rate those things will be exchanged at in the future (the inflation target). 

So that's what you get when you hold fiat. There's nothing imaginary about it, you're trading a token that'll entitle you to a predictable and diminishing amount of things from a country. Do you want to hold it? Maybe not, but the reason some claim that non-utility cryptocurrencies are somewhat imaginary by comparison is that they hold no such underlying claim. You simply exchange them for whatever the market wishes to pay. 

This isn't meant to be negative towards crypto - I hold plenty myself. I just think we should be realistic about what it is... and isn't."
2021-12-02,"The biggest and most meaningful difference though is that in a bank, your money is protected… to some extent even from the bank’s own mistakes via FDIC. Try getting a chargeback with crypto… it’ll never happen. 

Crypto doesn’t offer protections like that, which is both a good and a bad thing. I think overall, we’ll see banks start to improve as crypto undercuts a lot of their services."
2021-12-02,"Are you for real? The amount of rug pulls and market manipulation in crypto dwarfs FIAT. You also talk about average people going bankrupt and big corps getting bailouts. This has nothing to do with FIAT vs crypto at all.

I believe in it too. But this type of mental gymnastics is not helpful."

2021-12-02,"Okay, okay. But does that mean that my mortgage debt doesn’t exist, either? 

Or for that matter, does the deed that grants me the right to my real property exist either? 

Sure, on a fundamental level, the deed is only as good as it enforceable. My claim to land ownership is only as good as my ability to keep people off of it. Just ask the indigenous people of anywhere that has been colonized. But at the end of the day, we have some faith in the world’s governments to help us enforce these things.

>In that sense, I think that cryptocurrencies are actually more real then fiat money. Decentralised networks are much more resilient then centralised authorities, and therefore are more likely to survive in the long-term.


I get this reasoning, but it would take a huge event for the US government to completely dissolve.  The network systems of crypto are solid, but the valuation isn't tied to anything solid.    Technically neither is the dollar, it's a ""too big to fail"" house of cards but enough companies and governments are reliant on it that they will prop it up for as long as possible.  Crypto has the volatility of stock but isn't tied to a company with financials that you can evaluate.



I'd rather put my savings into the US government and rebuild in the case of total collapse, than put my savings in crypto and possibly rebuild based on the whim of the public."

2021-10-08,Too many of these negative posts about bitcoin and El Salvador are more politically based instead of numbers/facts based.
2021-10-08,Didn't read that entire post but were things he said untrue? He might have a bias vs crypto but what about the actual facts?
2021-10-08,"I would prefer a post countering his arguments rather than personal attacks ending in ""Lmao""."
2021-10-08,"To claim any reddit post is unbiased is extremely disingenuous. We all have biases, whether we admit to them or not."
2021-10-08,Nice ad hominem response.
2021-10-08,This post would have had a better impact without all the lmaos and lols
2021-10-08,This doesn’t disprove the point of his post though.
2021-10-08,"As an FYI, it really undermines your points when you end your sentences with 'lol/lmfao'."
2021-10-08,"The ONLY reason y'all try and talk up El Salvador and pretend everything is rosy there is because they adopted Bitcoin.  That's it.  Y'all would NEVER be trying to defend a corrupt third world country and its leadership in any other situation.

But of course, when you're on one side, being biased isn't a problem so long as somebody is heavily biased for your side. 

No self awareness with y'all whatsoever."
2021-10-08,I'm sick of people jumping to conclusions on this. Short term data means fuck all! This is a very interesting experiment and we need at least a years worth of data before we can say whether this is working or not
2021-10-08,"Yes, obviously his perspective is biased, couldn't avoid to notice during reading too. It's still another perspective though. Learning as many perspectives as possible is a good thing, right?"
2021-10-08,OP I feel like you’re just baiting for moons. Well congrats because it worked but you’re pretty lame for this one. Actually try to tackle what he was communicating instead of using argument fallacies to try and win. So fucking corny
2021-10-08,"""I'm not going to offer any actual evidence that his claims are false, I just don't like him.  LMAO"""
2021-10-08,Imagine thinking you could find an unbiased perspective on this subreddit. Lol.
2021-10-08,"IDK, Bitcoin going to 1K would be bad for our pockets as investors but would probably just represent a change in focus from speculation to utility. I bet at least 50k of the price is attributable to speculation, which is also fine with me.

Your anger at him makes me feel like you're cheering for a sports team more than thinking about Bitcoin as a technology. Talk about bias."
2021-10-08,"But this just proves the OP has a bias, doesn't prove what he said is wrong or false."
2021-10-08,Love exposing posts like these. Lets get this to the front page shall we?
2021-10-08,"Last month when it was adopted he posted some nonsense about bitcoin. He lied about there being no alternative to bitcoin even though it is an alternative and the USD is still accepted everywhere. I believe valid criticisms are fine and helpful to a conversation, but this guy is just a moon farmer"
2021-10-08,"I live a few countries from el salvador and I've heard a few negative stories about the adoption and a positive one being gas is a few cents cheaper now.

Personally, I wouldn't want my government imposing me a volatile coin as the main currency. And I hold bitcoin.

Just because you don't like it or is not bullish, it doesn't mean it's not true."

2021-02-06,Bro you gotta stop chasing hype. Take a breather and actually look into the investments you're making. Chasing pumps is the classic way to lose money in crypto. Take it from a 2017 veteran who got burned

2021-02-06,"Crypto goes up and down because of popularity for now but in the long term, I believe most coins we have now will increase in value, even from their peaks in 2017. This whole wallstreet thing has drawn so many people attention to the corruption that exists while also exposing many people to crypto. Once more people trust cryptocurrency more than they do fiat, which I feel is inevitable, anything you hold onto will be very valuable. As long as you’re not using money you can’t afford to lose in an attempt to ‘get rich quick’ you can just sit on it for a while, forget about it until the next time you see crypto all over the news."

2021-12-06,"One big problem in the crypto space, voting, and DAOs is the age-old problem with pure democracies.  Through history, people have always been mostly inclined to look at short term benefits over long term when it comes to group voting dynamics (possibly largely due to lack of information / education that would enable them to craft a big picture perspective).  People would vote for the candy man who gives away free cash rather than the doctor who tells them they have diabetes and prescribes horrible tasting but necessary medicine.

This is the reason why we do have layers in government because it enables people to place their trust in others to make better and more informed decisions for them, and they are the agents of the people.  This is one of the big things that I haven't seen crypto address.  The pendulum is too far in the other direction in this sphere."

2021-03-11,I was hoping for an actual analysis of ADA vs other competitors.
2021-03-11,"Bitcoin is overhyped but it's currently worth 72k.

Edit: 72k in AUD sorry guys lol"
2021-03-11,"One statement of yours that's interesting is the fact that you don't see it ever competing with ETH long term, why is that? Like a few others (DOT, ATOM) the tech to compete exists, and its almost impossible that any single coin will completely control the market, so what is your case that ADA isn't going to cement a reasonable market share, even just as a less successful competitor to ETH?"
2021-03-11,">hence why all the other ""Ethereum killers failed"" even with better tech

A big part of it was also that **they didn't actually have better tech**. Just have more tps is not enough. If you're centralized, as many were, many Ethereum enthusiasts won't even entertain the idea of using or developing on your network"
2021-03-11,A good post would be one that assesses each project's ability to be successful alongside ETH instead of competing with it. I'd learn something from that.

2021-03-11,I’ve noticed only non-ADA holders call ADA an ethereum killer. I’ve had ADA since 2017 and the ADA community has been consistent to say it’s not an ethereum killer. The projects will co-exist. No idea why there is so much ‘Ethereum killer’ rhetoric from the non-ADA holders.
2021-03-11,"Dude, you’re def not gonna get downvoted. Majority of others here put ETH over ADA any day.

Having said that, I’m really curious how this perception holds up through the rest of year. As long as Cardano delivers on what was stated, they have their future secured. And for me, I’m more excited for that than ETH 2.0."
2021-03-11,"It's actually not an unpopular opinion. The more attention Cardano has seen the Las few weeks, the more of this opinion I've seen here. It's natural and not uncommon."
2021-03-11,"Yeah, Cardano / ADA is definitely overhyped.



But If/when they deliver smart contracts, DApps, ERC20 converter, alongside native assets, staking, paying fees in native tokens, their lower fees etc. then of course it would be a potential ETH competitor (note..competitor, not killer).


Similarly you could say ETH2.0 Is overhyped. At present ETH offers expensive gas fees, environmentally toxic mining, locking your ETH away for years in hope that staking is rolled out successfully and the price doesn't collapse in the interim."

2021-02-06,"I have absolutely zero knowledge about crypto and why it's working at all.

2022-12-16,"1. You got to admire the audacity of this play and his ability to raise $4.5 million in that short a period of time.
2. This is a double-edge sword for crypto in general and NFTs in particular.  On one hand having someone high profile promoting them and showing that these types of items can generate income is a positive. On the other hand, Trump is polarizing (to put it mildly) and his mere association with crypto and NFTs can hurt public opinion, especially then the average person thinks NFTs are nothing more than pictures of apes."

That's crazy. Hope you continue earning good returns during this bull run, be sure to secure your profits along the way. 

A lot of us take for granted how secure we are financially, so investing and trading crypto isn't as stressful, but people in less wealthy countries like you have much more pressure on your shoulders"
2021-04-13,"As an American, I have to say that the problem with most Americans is that they don't realize (or perhaps care?) that there is a world outside of the USA.

2021-03-28,"Gary Gensler:  

Gensler clarified: “To the extent that somebody is offering an investment contract or security that’s under the SEC’s remit, and they have exchanges that operate there, then we have to make sure there’s investor protection.”

On the other hand, “If it’s not that, and it’s a commodity, as bitcoin has been deemed to be, then it’s either a question for Congress … or it’s possibly a question for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,” he described."

2021-03-28,"If the SEC wins the lawsuit it will be an event which produces effects that spread and then produces further effects, similar to when you throw a rock into a pond and observe a small wave or series of waves form on the surface of the water."
2021-03-28,The SEC doesn’t even have to win this case. They literally waved a wand against XRP and got it delisted from exchanges and blackbooked. The fact that exchanges like Coinbase delisted it without Ripple having their day in court goes to show how weak CeFi is in the face of governments.

Crypto is the most volatile space for investments out there. We are at high point in speculation and unfortunately this means a lot of scams. Stay safe out there."

this is why so many of us tell people not to invest in little known coins with scammy sounding devs and/or papers. we're honestly just trying to help. probably similar garbage odds to the lottery. there's still plenty to be made for all of us long term with the legitimate projects. 🙏"

2021-11-21,No. But the idea that Zuckerberg wants to dominate the metaverse really scares me. That’s some Black Mirror shit.
2021-11-21,"People spend like 90% of their time on the internet today, either on their computers, phones or TVs (streaming). Tell that to someone in 1990 and they’d laugh at you, they’d probably give the similar reasons (“wouldn’t you rather be outside”, etc.)

There is a trend towards things becoming digital and virtual, the metaverse is just the next step of that.

That being said, most of these early projects will probably die out when an actual “good” project hits it out of the park, ready player one style. Or perhaps they will survive long enough to evolve, who knows."
2021-11-21,It is just like the Internet thing in the 90’s: no one had the slightest idea what it would be like in 20-30 years. We will see
2021-11-21,I’m into it. Just not into Zuck’s metaverse.
2021-11-21,"I think the potential for a metaverse is phenomenal, how it will actually be implemented though will be beyond dreadful.

When people think metaverse they think and want Ready Player One, what we will actually get is Second Life with loads of ads, micro transactions, pay walls, data harvesting etc."
2021-11-21,"heh, I'm almost 50 and have VR integrated into my workflow and recreational time. i'm personally looking forward to seeing where it is going to go but have serious reservations of companies like FB getting heavily involved. Interestingly, my teen isn't into it at all, and most of his friends see it as a novelty so I accept i'm an outlier in this regard, for now at least."
2021-11-21,"The metaverse isn’t really one *thing*. It’s more of a *concept*. 

It doesn’t have to be all VR. There will likely be a component of VR. Who knows to what extent. 

But that is thinking too small. 

The metaverse will be the ultimate inter-connectivity of the real world to the digital world. Business, pleasure and everything in between will be able to be conducted as much in the digital space as in the physical space.

The real metaverse will be a hodgepodge if typical digital interface, AR, VR and likely things we haven’t even fathomed at this point. And it will all be interconnected with true permanence and proof of ownership. 

I don’t think we can really say what the metaverse will look like at this point. And to say it will all be VR is in my opinion, naive and narrow minded."
2021-11-21,"It sound like SIMS + SOCIAL MEDIA in order to advertise you shit and steal your data.

Hard pass for me"
2021-11-21,"Metaverse reminds me of that second life game. I really don’t understand the hype for it.

I’m not saying related coins won’t rocket up due to all the hype in this market, but I thought second life was stupid so I’m not going to be trying any of these"
2021-11-21,"I’m not a gamer at all. I’m a little too old- missed the gaming scene mainly due to age. But I’ll be honest I put on a v/r a couple years ago and played a game at a buddies-  it was way cool. It was amazing how once I took them off I was disoriented. It was almost like getting Knocked out and coming too. It took a minute to readjust and I only played the game for like 2 minutes. I can totally see how someone can get lost in it, or want to live in it etc. when you come out the current world isn’t near as cool. This is coming from someone in their 40’s who never played games like I said.

Putting them on and going into the game was cool and this was a few years ago so graphics weren’t anything like they are now. The game I played was a shooting game. Graphics were nothing special I can’t even imagine being in a metaverse. Could you imagine going anywhere in the world you ever wanted to go?  You could be in a jungle, in a city, on the beach etc. at least that’s what I imagine we are talking about."
2021-11-21,It doesn’t appeal to me either. I like grass and trees and stuff.
2021-11-21,Facebook is the literal septic tank of the internet why would i want to put on goggles and live in this tank?
2021-11-21,"Before any of these games existed, there was *Second Life*. A dumpsterfire of a game where you could own in game land and the internal currency would be treated as real money.

I setup an account at one point just to take a peek because the shit is free to start. Was greeted to either bots or typical spammers in game loitering around trying to scam your shit. Signed out in 5 minutes and never returned.

Now we are seeing the idea revisted and you need to invest in the gear to actually handle playing the shit to get into it, making it exclusive to those who can afford it. Essentially I feel like it is a trap for children of the rich and any common idiot mispending their cash."
2021-11-21,The only metaverse i would join and play would be a GTA style metaverse
2021-11-21,"If I can walk down the physical street, and see all the meta-information that the world has collected, I would be overwhelmed.  by overlaying a filter, augmenting reality to include the necessary meta-data for optimizing my sensory intake I would be maximizing my knowledge of my surroundings.  to me the metaverse is just bridging the gap between the digital and the physical.  the online world transposed over our physical.  I don't want to strap in and enter the metaverse, I want the metaverse to be a smooth integration over my beloved physical universe.  and opensource and free to access."
2021-11-21,I would guess that most here think it sucks.
2021-11-21,"Magic money was also not appealing at first 

NFTs we thought was a joke 

Meta verse? I can see it used for making money. If Second Life was any indication back in the day If done right it could take off"
2021-11-21,"Thanks, i'll pass. Zuckerberg can play hide and seek or second life or whatever with his ""friends"" in his online metaverse all day long if he wants to. I won't join. Ain't nobody got no time for that shit. Neither am i keen on giving this fool even more information about myself and my environment."
2021-11-21,"I think it can be AMAZING for people with disabilities. Other than that, tbh I’m very freaked out"
2021-11-21,"I personally think it is an awful idea, sadly most people are already busy hiding from reality and the metaverse will enable them further. Add to that half the world is getting locked down with covid, I think it will take off massively"

I always saw myself as someone who was smart with my money and fairly conservative investor as a boglehead but I got greedy when I was introduced to Celsius. I mostly had USDC in Celsius so this will be a very expensive life lesson to move forward with. It wasn’t close to my life savings but still nothing to scoff at. I really hope others that lost a bigger % of their savings will be okay. It sucks but just remember money isn’t everything. I’m just rambling at this point but good luck my other celsians.

It feels safer than sending to an address and hoping it’s correct."

2022-05-17,">The only reason why would they do that is because their supply fell significantly in these 3 days and they don't want more people to follow. how much are they hiding from these 3 days?

Nothing? [The onchain data](https://messari.io/asset/tether/chart/sply-circ) of the supply looks exactly the same as what Coin Market Cap is reporting, so I'm not sure why you have an issue with those numbers, since they appear to in fact be flat for the past three days.

And as others pointed out, the ""news"" section of their website has a recent update about the coins being burned. What exactly do you think they are hiding that wouldn't also appear on the blockchain?"
2022-05-17,"I think you have the dates wrong. On both CMC and CoinGecko, you can see that the supply decreased from 83B to 76B between May 10 to May 14. Nothing new happened in the past 3 days, so their website is correct."
2022-05-17,i can’t wait in ten years for the retrospective documentaries on how obvious bullshit this all was.  Crypto that exists to be held and go up will never have a place. Monero and other currencies that are meant purely for transactions and don’t cere about medium or long term value but merely private utility are the true use case for crypto and always will be.

2022-05-17,"People have said crypto doesn't need regulations because the community self regulates. Many of those same people have turned a blind eye to Tether. It will eventually fail, and when it does, some of the same people who helped create and drive crypto out of the ashes of the hypocrisy of ""Too Big To Fail"" and the financial crisis/freakonomic economic policy will ask for the same bail out policies to be implemented in crypto. Crazy to watch history just repeat itself slowly. I hope when crypto hits commercial scales it still has some semblance of what it was meant to be."

2022-05-17,Tether might be the most obvious large-scale fraud in the history of the world .
2022-05-17,yeah tether is probably a scam but does anybody here really believe that a company that not only has been around forever but also has deep ties to ftx and binance (just look who got most tether) will collapse so easily? they have all the tools to manipulate the market in their way...  and unlike luna they are not bound to openess which makes it incredibly hard for short sellers to estimate their reserves.

It's incredibly dependant on the price of bitcoin, and the platforms token, as well as stable coins holding their peg. There is no guarantee they will hold their peg. With stable coins, you take the risk that always comes with the dollar, devaluation, and possible hyperinflation, but the extra risk of the stable coin collapsing. It is still a risky investment by any metric. I have done well in defi, but it's still an experiment, and it has only existed in a bull market.

2021-04-09,"For a dumb down Version...

Tokens are usually for utility on a platform or offered as shares aka Tokenized shares, and usually use another blockchain to issue the tokens.      ERC-20 the most well known.

Apps like Aptoide made their own economy for their app store using ERC-20 and the raiden network, and can be traded in for in game content or extra features or whatever.   That's where the utility part comes in.

The good news is, I've been doing this for two years and now that the infastructure bills has passed were really making progress! We're getting them signed on to provide our services at no cost to the user, they are learning how to produce proper 1099-Bs I stead of those god awful 1099-Ks. 

We're getting connected to their leadership team and explaining exactly how all this shit works and they are giving us access to developers to build better APIs that actually give us all the transactions. The work we are doing is mostly unique to our company, but the work we are doing will ultimately improve the space across the board as they roll out updated APIs.

This sounds awesome at the first glance.


On the second one though: wouldn't the integrity of the voting process be at risk if it was soley smart-contract-based?

Since the contract would be a single weakpoint for all the results, an attack would need much fewer ressources to succeed. It would basically be invisble for a normal citizen as well.


A paper based system would be more resilient to these problems - and it has an enormous advantage.
Nearly everyone (even Florida man on coke) would be able to read and certify the content of a paper vote.


A smart contract based vote though, well, a handfull of specialists would be the only guys able to re-verify. Which is another weakpoint/attack vector itself. 

What is your view on these aspects?

2021-03-27,"> Because the smart contract is connected to a database that keeps track of flight times, the function can be performed automatically and paid for via the Ethereum blockchain.

Then that system isn't really distributed, is it? There's a centralized database somewhere keeping track of flighttimes. And it's not like those times are gathered passively at the airport, they are likely reported by airlines who would pull the same BS that they do now to manipulate times. (Things like pulling away from the gate on time even if they know they'll be stuck on the tarmac for an hour).

And a bug in that database could lead to lots of unintended payouts on the part of the insurer. So much so that it might be in the insurer's interest to put an intermediary between the database and the contract execution, to confirm that the flight was already late.

I personally think that any smart contracts that make use of oracles are no better than their non-smart versions...."
2021-03-27,"Nice write-up!

As a feedback, I would love to read a section about the risks of engaging with the technology in topic. In the case of smart contracts for example, they are mostly bugs, exploits and unintentional or intentional miscoding, with maybe some examples like you did for the use cases. Not for feeding FUD, but because I think it makes for a more comprehensive article"

2022-01-04,"Reason why Solana is fast is because most of validators ( SOL devs ) are on mainframe computers. Dedicated to just their network. It has good and bad sides.   


That said, they will need to decentralize their network and fast. This is very bad. 

&#x200B;

>Blaming it on attackers is just dishonesty. A well designed blockchain is not supposed to have attackers, its supposed to keep producing blocks based on the parameters of the network, not take a break because someone spammed transactions.

I would love to defend SOL on this matter, but you are right. A simple DDOS should not take a whole network down.   


It is in beta, as they claim. But that sounds more and more like a good excuse for any downfall."

2022-01-04,"So I’m going to get downvoted… I have to disagree with some of these points, cus they are quite literally not the truth. Please keep reading though, I’m not trying to shill Solana - I was one of many on the discord last night screaming at the team to get an official announcement out, in fact I’m pretty sure it was me who got their head of communication to finally actually tweet that there are problems with the network.

First point: the network never went down… it slowed to around 500-1000 TPS. It was still a shit user experience, but the network didn’t go offline. You can check this.

Point 2: Coinbase literally never said that Solana went down. You can go on their status page and see what it actually said. It was along the lines of there is network congestion, withdraws may fail “BUT YOU ARE WELCOME TO RETRY” - if they are saying you can retry, how would this be possible if the network was down?

There was supposed to be a public launch of an OHM fork yesterday, and bots were spamming the liquidity pool of it, even before it was unlocked. Someone was spamming the network with cheap txns, but the pool wasn’t even enabled… once the bot ran out of gas/stopped, the network started returning to normal.

The team apparently said they have fixed these large txns in blocks in the last 2 validator updates, however that simply can’t be true as we still have these issues.

Anatoly also said he never wanted to increase fees dependant on traffic, however guess what was being discussed last night in the discord?

Also a little fun fact for anyone still reading: Solana’s head of communication was literally posting pictures of Sunsets on Twitter as the network was on fire… I cannot understand how he could not see the irony, both being the head of communication, and the sunset picture during a bad time for the network."

through defi, and lending and staking crypto is by far the best asset at creating cash flow. Not only will you see % gains in cash flow many times over the stock market, the asset itself is likely to appreciate in value tremendously.

I have 2FA as an added layer, but hackers can social engineer there way into getting that too. Password managers are convenient but they scare me, as they are still a single point of failure, and that failure would be absolutely catastrophic."
2021-04-20,"Regarding 1.) Bitwarden is also a great alternative to KeePass.

Regarding 2.) Digital hygiene is important, but the greatest (most vulnerable and unsafe) attack vector is yourself.

9) Keep your computer updated with it's security patches and antivirus.  I don't care if you hate microsoft.  Keep your computer patched.

If you are not familiar with Social Engineering, look it up, but essentially it's a clever way for hackers to pretend they are you and gain access to your phone, your email, etc. The more they know about you (family, friends, acquaintances) the higher chance they have of successfully impersonating you. It can be shockingly effective, so **do not make yourself a target**.

Food, flowers, bones, hand axes, shells, stones, metal coins, paper, plastic, crypto. All these slowly improve upon the previous place holders for value relative to changing circumstances. It's the natural evolutionary progression unless our tech has peaked and our species has peaked. Maybe, but im bullish on crypto and space travel because everything seems to point that direction.

2022-01-19,">Why is everyone so sure that crypto will always bounce back strong at some point?

I'll add something to make it more relevant. Everyone is sure that `their own crypto investment` will bounce back strong at some point.

1. In regards to crypto as a general, I think many people simply understand that `applied decentralized logic` will become a huge part of humanity in some point.
2. Then there are a lot of people that just see the investment side of it, and they just hope their tokens bounces. These people will say whatever to pump their hopes and are more similar to people betting on things or too deep into pyramid schemes.
3. And lastly, there's people that think their own crypto projecst are the best suited for a specific use case, and that they will always bounce back or grow constantly, which is most likely not true for most. I myself think Polkadot and it's ecosystem is the sure winner on layer0 blockchains, and while I try to make this decision objectively, I might be completely wrong

2022-01-19,"As of 2021, the global crypto users were estimated at around 300 m users. That’s like 3.9%. Now compare that to the following adoption statistics:

2016: 5 m users 
2017: 18 m users
2018: 35 m users

Now forget 2019 & 2020 and let’s go to a few months in 2021:

And the number of users just keep going up. 

In 2020 and after we started hearing from institutions, banks, investors, presidents, governments & billionaire business people shilling crypto. Some were vocally against crypto but that’s also kinda good because when officials are against something, people will get interest and look in to it. 

Moreover crypto as a new product is advancing. Everyday there are new “products” coming out; some are useless and some are beneficial but that’s normal on the road to perfection. Remember windows, MacBook, iPhone, Netflix,… etc as a product. They sucked. 

In the crypto world we now have currencies and networks. We have NFT’s & web 3. Many new innovations will come out. We have exchanges linking credit cards to crypto & money (crypto) that can be sent around the world in a blink of an eye. 

I know kids (12 yrs olds) that are buying and saving up from their little pocket monies some small coins. (God bless them). 

The crypto world is a rocket factory that doesn’t tire from making rockets. A rocket can only go up. It might explode. It might fail manytimes. But eventually it will go to space and beyond the moon & Mars.

2. Bitcoin is deflationary and scarce. It's value is secured by history's most powerful (and emissions intensive) computer and the fact that more than 21 million Bitcoin can not be mined and people who forget their keys effectively deflate the currency, increasing it's real world value.

2022-01-19,"I’ve made a bit of money on Crypto and I still hold some, but not much anymore. I don’t believe that any coin is, was, or ever will be a sure bet

Right now, the value of crypto is solely in its connection to fiat currency. You can buy a pizza with crypto but the only way someone knows how much a pizza costs in BTC is by some quick math against the current price. You could get paid in crypto, but the number of coins per month is going to fluctuate with the cost of whichever coin. No company is going to pay a flat coin rate right now because it could cost them 1k/month or 40k/month with the extreme volatility.

The volatility is a bug, not a feature, and it is the number one reason that more crypto exchange does not happen. And in conjunction with that, as more crypto exchange does happen, the value will become more stable, leading to less wild swings (and thus less overnight millionaires). 

Basically, crypto is not a safe investment, and don’t treat it as such. You’re not on the ground floor of something big. Don’t spend what you can’t afford lose. But there will probably be a lot more pumps along the way and someone will tell me how wrong I was, and that’s fine. But don’t convince yourself that it’s any better than any other volatile investment (other than being easier to buy in to)."
2022-01-19,"Theres too much money in it, too many rich people already onboard, they wont let it fail. Also i believe that it brings some new stuff to the table. Like for example the btc tiping/transfers on twitter. In my country i pay flat fee of 25$ for wire transfer to other countries. So the bank screws me on the conversion ratio from my currency to $, sends the wire with the 25$ fee, then it arrives in the destination and again if the country currency is different than $ screws the person again or ratio. Not to mention the wire takes days. Just before christmas i was sending a wire from czechia to germany and the frickin wire took 10 days to execute..

Im not saying the crypto and blockchain as it stands now is a solution to everything, but we will definitely need it in the future in some shape or form."
2022-01-19,"Everything is pegged to BTC, it's just the way this market works. Every 4 years (3 years 10 months approx) we have an event called halving. Basically after a certain amount of blocks are mined the total payout per block decreases by 50%. Currently it's at 6.25 from memory and in 2025 the next halving will happen (dropping to 3.125 naturally). So demanding stays the same if not increases over time while supply drops 50%. This causes a huge price spike as the supply to demand chart gets thrown out of wack. So as long as BTC is still seen as a valuable asset to hold (which I doubt it will ever fall out of interest) it will constantly crash upwards every 4 years."
2022-01-19,"At this point the entire world is in a type of recession.  New covid waves disrupt supply chain issues which causes economic halts.  Inflation is rising at rates not seen since the early eighties so people are desperate to hold onto their money until we reach some kind of stability, causing less frivolous spending, which includes hobbies, travel, and even investing.  Unless this is somehow the end of the modern era as we know it, eventually the world will pass the stage of COVID and spending will return to normal levels.  But we have to survive until then.  So don't be shocked if right now people really don't give a fuck about investing in a volatile market while they're worried if a gallon of milk is going to be 5 dollars next month.

Maybe it'll happen; maybe it won't. Maybe it'll be amended; maybe it won't. Either way, IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET so it's pure clickbait to speak about it as if it has."

Another amazing example of basic utilization serving an important purpose."
2022-03-15,"“I posed a question about crypto to Alex Bornyakov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation. Since the Russian invasion, Mr. Bornyakov and his team — led by the country’s digital minister, Mykhailo Fedorov — have been working around the clock to coordinate crypto donations for Ukraine’s army. Tens of millions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies have been sent to these addresses, and the money has been used to buy military supplies, including bulletproof vests and night-vision goggles.

Mr. Bornyakov, who was speaking from an undisclosed location in Ukraine on a video conference hosted by the artificial intelligence company Collective[i], said that one advantage of using crypto to raise money was how quickly the funds could be disbursed.

“In a situation like this, where the national bank is not fully operating, crypto is helping to perform fast transfers, to make it very quick and get results almost immediately,” he said.

But Mr. Bornyakov seemed wary of overstating crypto’s importance to the Ukrainian cause.

“I don’t think crypto is playing a major part,” Mr. Bornyakov said. “But its role is essential in this conflict in terms of helping our army.”"

They talk a lot about it, but few people can quote any real cases of cyberthreats. I’ll give you a simple example. When we arrived at the president’s office, the IT team showed the dashboards with 1,000 attacks a day, website overload, etc. Two weeks later we fired them and nothing has happened over several months while we were forming a new team"" https://en.lb.ua/news/2019/11/29/8183_role_cybersecurity_slightly.html"

2021-11-13,"I suppose it ultimately depends on one's openness to Risk:

1) Bitcoin: Least risky, Least room to grow as you pointed out.

2) ETH: My personal choice, i think it holds a good middle ground between risk/room to grow, for me personally i can see myself sitting with my ETH for 2-3 years easy.

3) ADA: The risky bet, and arguably the roulette choice,  this is where you could YOLO, but if the Cardano smartchain does not take off, you are looking at a bag that would lose alot of value over time."
2021-11-13,Get the ETH so I have enough for gas fees to move around my $50 of ETH stuck in my wallet
2021-11-13,ETH. Always get more ETH.
2021-11-13,Id prefer 1 Btc as I am risk averse (compared to other crypto investors)
2021-11-13,ADA then stake.
2021-11-13,I'd take 1 BTC
2021-11-13,"ADA has the most potential for growth but also the highest likelihood of the three to just fizzle out. BTC is the safest option but has the least growth potential. ETH has almost as much staying power as BTC at this point but with more growth potential (though certainly less than ADA).

I think ETH has the best risk/reward ratio for a long-term investment. BTC is the right choice if you don't really need (much) gains and would rather have a safer nest egg. ADA is the choice if the shot at way higher gains is worth the potential risk of losing all or most of it for you.

Overall, I think ETH is the smartest choice for most people and what I'd rather have (and is what I hold the most of). 

That said, if we're talking about some hypothetical situation where I'm just getting the above crypto for free? Then I think the ADA is a lot more tempting. If I never put anything into it myself that skews the risk part of the risk/reward evaluation a lot, so the chance at it turning into 'fuck you' money might just be worth it (even if I personally think that chance is relatively low atm)."

2021-03-31,"I think I generally agree with what you're saying, but there's another thing to point out in support of your position:

There are plenty of whitepapers that are created more for marketing and appearances than for anything else. Actually, you could say that the real requirement for a whitepaper is that it's hard enough to understand that most readers give up and assume the writers of the white paper actually know what they're talking about. Of course this isn't the requirement for a ethically responsible whitepaper... just the whitepaper that is useful when someone wants to pump a coin."
2021-03-31,"I'm not smart enough to understand the intricacies of the white paper. But I learnt from those who understood it, they usually explain why it's important. And that's enough for an average person like me."
2021-03-31,I skim read the bitcon white paper. Then I realized Ill never read another one again. Ill take the summarsed jargon free for idiots version please.
2021-03-31,"> I say this because I've taken several high level CS courses in college

I have a masters degree in CS. So I understand most of what they write. And I mostly read the whitepaper as a bullshit test. Most of the time it is easy to spot a buzzword paper and easy to spot which papers are actual work."
2021-03-31,Sometimes projects also have light papers which are more targeted towards non-technical people. Those are worth a read.
2021-03-31,"It’s okay man I try to read those research papers in machine learning domain and try to implement them. I always fail even at the reading and comprehending what the paper is even trying to say.

That’s why some professionals read those papers fully and create something called “gist” which is essentially a condensed version of the technicalities.

You can also always read someone’s review/video on the whitepaper. You don’t need to understand the raw whitepaper itself"
2021-03-31,Is this a tutorial for going all in on shit coins?
2021-03-31,"I still think it's important to glance over the whitepaper and try to understand the overarching concepts. The main reasons I like to read through are:

1) I might not understand the intricacies of the computer science/statistical concepts, but reading through improves my knowledge on the broad concepts. The next time I read a whitepaper built with similar technology I will recognise it (and draw comparisons between the tech/highlight competitors);

2) Whitepapers can be huge red flags. I have looked though some projects that have a fancy website, an active social media team but a whitepaper that looks like it was written by a child. Even just a quick glance through the exec summary is enough to know that the team behind the project are just looking to build hype."
2021-03-31,I haven’t read a single white paper and I’m up 500% lol
2021-03-31,"It's not just the CS, some whitepapers include very complex mathematics and economics concepts. You literally have to have a combination of all three at a high level to fully understand some of them."
2021-03-31,"i highly doubt that 90% of crypto buyers know what the projects they are invested in are about. they are just chasing pumps and then shilling their coins. 

that‘s the reason i bought vechain. i think what they are doing is pretty simple."
2021-03-31,"Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but I don't think when people say ""read the whitepaper"" they literally mean it, but more they mean to say ""don't invest in what you don't understand"". 

There's so many scammy coins out there, and they're all promising to be the next big thing, and there's newbies out there that see BTC at over 50,000 and realize they're not going to be rich buying BTC now, or anytime soon, so they look to alt coins. 

You don't tell someone like that to read the whitepaper so they understand the coin. To actually understand it you also need to read all the other white papers. How do you know if a white paper is any good, if you haven't read the nakomoto paper, the Ethereum papers, Monero, Ripple, Stellar? You wouldn't have any context.

Even if you read all the papers it still doesn't mean shit about the market value. Perhaps Cardano was better designed than Ethereum, doesn't matter because Ethereum was better executed and marketed. Stellar is much closer to an actual cryptocurrency than Ripple is, doesn't matter because Ripple had mega funding.

On the other side, if you only look to the marketing and hype, you'll find yourself buying Bitconnect or some shit, that will literally turn to shit the second it's closely scrutinized.

To properly invest you need to build a very complete picture of what you're investing in. That might include reading the paper, or watching explainer vids on youtube, but it also means knowing the context, all the other currencies and what they're working on, and keeping a close eye on the development and execution, or you'll find the founders have already exited to the Bahamas while you're holding the bags."
2021-03-31,lol I've tried to read so many of them and mostly understand nothing.
2021-03-31,"I'm with you OP. 

I've read like 3 whitepapers in 3 years of being in crypto. I'm not an IT guy, cryptographer, or anything like it but I consider myself low to medium literate in IT and blockchain.

I'm not ashamed to admit I still don't understand 90% of stuff out there. What the hell is a ""open-source sharding multichain protocol that facilitates the cross-chain transfer of any data or asset type""?? How do I explain that to my parents? Or to the crypto regulators in my country?"
2021-03-31,"I also won't recommend whitepapers to investors and newcomers, instead I'll recommend them to read the projects goal. 

But if you're in for the tech and you can't understand it, try learning how to understand it, then maybe you could contribute and gain more in depth knowledge from it. I have CS degree and been in this industry for a decade, just my 0.2 Algorands.

Adoption won't happen soon but people will realize it gradually. Even the transition from barter system to ""money"" took centuries."
2021-03-31,"This inspired me to actually try and read a white paper. I have a phd in math and have been studying computer science and computational complexity for quite some time. I opened up the new LEO token white paper. It makes no sense to me. It turns out a phd in math (or computer science) isn't really useful when it comes to reading such things. To learn how to read white papers, it seems that one should... READ WHITE PAPERS. I imagine that good investors, whether or not they have a fancy degree, are able to understand these or at least get some insight from it. Like anything it just takes time and patience. I wouldn't discourage people from putting in this effort."
2021-03-31,"Honestly, I've read white-papers and I have a tech background and it still doesn't really matter because there is also a chance that the white-paper is full of shit or the team is fake or they're lying about something etc. That said, those things do help you filter out when something seems fishy (like vague statements about the token economies etc)

Just because you've read a white-paper doesn't mean it counts as complete due diligence."
2021-03-31,"Yep same here. 
I’ve tried to read the Bitcoin whitepaper loads of times. Even printed it out. 

Not a fucking clue about most of it and I still giggle at the nonce bit."

2021-05-26,"This post is fantastic, nice explanation. I love it and I'm behind it, but it also exposes the heart of my main scepticism about crypto, which is this: if crypto is supposed to be a means of peer to peer, unmediated exchange, it must also have a stable value in real terms, that is in terms of the real goods and services you can buy with it. If vendors start accepting crypto payments, this necessitates that cryptos have a stable value with relation to the local government backed currency too (because even if the average consumer uses only crypto, vendors will continue to need to use both crypto and their government backed currency to pay their taxes, overheads etc, which they can't reliably account for if the value of crypto is fluctuating wildly). Unless governments entirely ditch the modern banking system, I can't conceive of how the day to day economy can reliably operate with both currencies simultaneously, other than in a situation like ours now where crypto remains essentially a prospecting opportunity. There's a big leap in terms of *regulatory* action needed to take crypto from an ""investment"" vehicle which is ultimately reliant on the value of fiat, to a true currency which stands alone as a means of exchange."

2022-04-08,"Seeing a lot of misunderstanding on this one, so let me lay it down... the bullish thing about this announcement is NOT that merchants are starting to accept crypto as payment, its that the Bitcoin NETWORK can now be used as a payment rail in the same way as Visa. The difference is that settlement is done instantly and for almost free compared to Visa's 3% fee.

You DONT have to spend your Bitcoin.

You can pay in fiat, it gets converted automatically into Btc, sent over the bitcoin network to the merchants bank and converted back into fiat. It all happens instantly and for free, so Btc price volatility is irrelevant.

2022-04-08,">Jack Mallers of Strike announced in Miami that Bitcoin will be available via the Lightning Network to over 400,000 storefronts and all US Shopify sites.

>During the presentation, a slide appeared listing some of the biggest retailers in America, including McDonald’s, Walmart, Home Depot, and Best Buy. According to their websites, Blackhawk and NCR also serve Starbucks, Chipotle, El Corte Ingles, Lowe’s, Staples, Woolworths, and thousands of other global retailers.



Am I dreaming?"
2022-04-08,"Suprised BTC didn’t give a candle at all 

Wonder if this was already well known"
2022-04-08,Misleading and Cringe.
2022-04-08,Too bad the LN is such a mess. Honestly feeling worried about it. I love BTC but LN is a house of cards …
2022-04-08,"I do read different things here. Some claim, that mcDonalds, starbucks etc will accept crypto via lightning. Other sources claim that mcDonads, starbucks etc \*can theoretically\* accept crypto via lightning.

There is a huge difference between laying out a network where companies can settle paymants and laying out a network where companies have agreed to settle payments.

Are there any official statements from those listed companies where they clearly state they embrace the new settlement system? Because I feel like we are just talking about the opportunity here and many may not jump onto the bandwagon because of regulatory unclarity? Or is this basically a done thing? If so, in which countries?"
2022-04-08,Whelp. That's one hell of an adoption if you ask me!
2022-04-08,"This is just another step toward global adoption of cryptocurrency. You don’t have to use this payment method, you don’t even have to like it but nevertheless, it’s exposure. Exposure to the masses. This is a good thing. Bitcoin and crypto have come a long way from simply being on the fringe and steps like this will improve upon the neutral or negative sentiment held toward crypto by the normies"
2022-04-08,"Fake news

These companies CAN accept payment

Not that they currently ARE"
2022-04-08,"I feel like the mods should tag this as misleading. 

I don’t believe McDonalds has announced anything at all related to Bitcoin. They simply have the ability to accept Bitcoin now with existing infrastructure. 

The amount of times crypto people on this subreddit feel proud over articles that are purposely misleading is a bit upsetting. Hopium is real."
2022-04-08,Is there a way to invest in the lightning network?
2022-04-08,This could be a big step for Bitcoin
2022-04-08,Yeah.... nah....
2022-04-08,"Did no one read the linked article? Theyre not confirmed to be soon accepting BTC, but that now they have the ability to accept BTC if they choose to

>According to Mallers, any website that uses Shopify online card transactions can now process payments using Bitcoin’s Lightning Network."
2022-04-08,Already done and converted to XTZ
2022-04-08,"It will be hard to make the SEC to stop crying about most cryptocurrencies being securities, when noone is spending shit and people just hodl their stacks, hoping for overtime appreciation. 

Do you really see that mentality change anytime soon?"
2022-04-08,"Isnt this misleading? Shopify has allowed BTC payments for ages. Now they support lightning network. That doesnt mean McDonalds is going to use this method to accept BTC as payment.

The option exists but none of the companies have announced that they are taking up that option. Just sounds like more Bitcoin Conference overhype"
2022-04-08,"Here’s to hoping they don’t roll this back in X months (as almost every other big corp has done).

Even Tesla stopped accepting crypto after three months:

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-stop-accepting-bitcoin-for-car-purchases.html

These announcements have almost always been a short term PR play."
2022-04-08,i think lightning network is the best system although the most interesting aspect of it for me is that it doesn't have to be limited to serving btc
2022-04-08,Really? Wow! That's a true everyday life adoption step!
